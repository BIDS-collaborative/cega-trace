CHOICE AND CHANGE IN THE AMERICAN WELFARE SYSTEM,"Public welfare policy during the 1960's has come to assign priority to a cash-transfer policy. A public debate has ensued about the form that new or reformed cash transfers might take. While debating, we have introduced changes in our cash-transfer system, esp in the means-tested sector, without having explicitly chosen to take the direction which these changes imply. Thus, the changes that we have already adopted warrant serious re-examination. 2 of the issues in doubt are discussed. In some states we have already assured benefit levels in public assistance at or near the poverty line & have added an incentive scheme to this guarantee. We justify this policy by the faith that 'add-on' will lead to 'take-off.' This change in policy, however, is more likely to lead to the curious outcome that fam's are likely to be better off econ'ly when they are both at work & on welfare. To avoid this dilemma, we need a wagelevel policy which seeks to raise the wages in the marginal low-wage economy & to make it an alternative, rather than a supplement, to benefits. The impact which improvements in low wages could have on the rest of the economy is a critical issue, characterized more by passion than by understanding. We have been reluctant to debate a wage-level policy, & this remains the basic issue in the public review of cash transfers.

Income Redistribution and Social Security: A Response,"In an earlier article M. N. Ozawa ('Income Redistribution and Social Security,' Social Service Review, 1976, 50, June, 209-223) 'reorganized published data to show redistributive impacts of social security & public assistance on total income received by families of various income classes,' but was unable to disaggregate the groupings into demographic groups. S. Danziger was able to accomplish this disaggregation ('Income Redistribution and Social Security: Further Evidence,' Social Service Review, 1977, 51, Mar, 179-184). He also computed changes in mean income & Gini coefficients. Danziger's conceptual framework for calculating changes in mean income & Gini coefficients is discussed & research problems which derive from his observation on the increasing degree of inequality in income are explored. It is suggested that an estimate more precise than Danziger's 'of the net effect of social security can be otained by comparing the mean & the Gini coefficient of money income net of social security & public assistance, on one hand, & the mean & the Gini coefficient of money income net of public assistance, on the other.' Using this model it was found that the change in the mean income of all families due to social security benefits was 4.89% rather than Danziger's 4.83%. Methods used by Danziger to obtain the net effect of public assistance are consistent with the hierarchical order of income transfers. Further research is suggested in order to explore the effects of the changing tax structure on the distribution of income & to answer the questions of why the degree of income inequality has not been decreased despite growing expenditures for income-maintenance programs. In Author's Reply, S. Danziger (U of Wisconsin, Madison) describes his use of computer tapes from the Mar 1975 Current Population Survey in applying Ozawa's hierarchical odering to an analysis of 'the degree of poverty reduction attributable to three types of government cash transfers': social security, other government transfers, & public assistance. Findings agree with both researchers' previous results. Social security transfers are more redistributive than public assistance transfers, although social security is less target efficient than public assistance. 1 Table. G.

Women and Poverty: Are They Synonyms?,"Statistical evidence shows clearly that women are especially vulnerable to poverty despite their participation in an array of cash transfer programs. US social welfare policies reflect & legitimize the stereotype of women economically dependent on men. Analysis of social security & AFDC programs confirm that support of economic roles for women as members of the LF is not an intended purpose of our welfare program; yet, as social welfare recipients, women experience discrimination as well, even as they conform to society's dictates that they remain at home as dependents of their husbands.

Diagnosis and the Dole: The Function of Illness in American Distributive Politics,"It is argued that the concept of illness has certain properties that make it a convenient administrative device for managing a need-based redistributive system in a society whose primary distributive system is based on work. These properties -- cultural acceptance of illness as a legitimate excuse for not working, objective standards for identifying illness, & restrictiveness -- have led to the widespread use of illness as an eligibility criterion for many social benefits, including cash transfers, services, privileges, & exemptions. Paradoxically, the traditional rationales for using illness as one of the keystones of categorical welfare policy are eroding, yet welfare programs based on illness certification are growing rapidly. To explain this anomaly it is suggested that medical certification as a distributive mechanism serves certain latent political functions, eg: allowing welfare programs to be responsive to political unrest, siphoning off opposition to controversial policies by the granting of medical exemptions to intense opponents, & reducing political conflict by using MDs as arbiters. 4 Tables.

Cash Transfers and the Export Base of Small Communities,"An export base model of local employment growth is proposed for cases which one of the ""export"" sectors is cash transfer payments to individuals. The basic sectors considered are: agriculture, manufacturing, intergovernmental transfers, & cash transfers to individuals. The model is tested with data from a sample of 276 US counties. Cash transfers are found to have strong positive effects on local nonbasic employment growth. Manufacturing & agriculture were also found to have significant effects. Also in the model are ecological qualities such as industrial diversity & urbanization of the local community. The findings & hypotheses are discussed in relation to the ""population turnaround"" of nonmetropolitan communities, to the growth of social welfare payments, to the economic significance of cash transfers to local communities, & to the Keynesian macro approach to economic growth. 6 Tables.

"ON THE POLITICAL ECONOMY OF WELFARE EXPANSION: A COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS OF 18 ADVANCED CAPITALIST DEMOCRACIES, 1960-1971","THIS ARTICLE ELABORATES THE THESIS THAT ECONOMIC GROWTH AND VARIOUS TYPES OF COLLECTIVE ACTION BY CLASS-LINKED ACTORS DETERMINE THE EXPANSION AND DECLINE OF WELFARE SPENDING IN RICH CAPITALIST DEMOCRACIES.

Food Prices and the Poor in Developing Countries,"A discussion of the impact of food prices on the welfare of the Ur & Ru poor in a variety of Third World countries. Some policy options available to governments for shielding the poor from the unfavorable effects of rising food prices include explicit general subsidies, targeted food price subsidies, & alternative measures, eg, tied or untied cash transfers, food transfers, or food-for-work programs. In Opening of the Discussion on Plenary Paper 5, Malcolm D. Bale (The World Bank, 1818 H-Street NW Washington DC 20433) suggests that a useful indicator may be the share of population receiving less than their daily energy needs, & suggests providing nutritionally sound, although culturally undesirable, food goods to this group. Price reforms in agriculture that remove distortions can be thought of as moving a society toward higher overall national productivity; compensatory measures to aid the poor should only be needed in the short run. In Comment on Plenary Paper 5, Hartwig DeHaen (U of Gottingen, Federal Republic of Germany) suggests a combination of reducing price distortions to increase long-term productivity & supporting the poor with targeted food subsidies. Some problems that must be addressed by such a development strategy are noted. 25 References. W. H.

"Cash Equivalence, Welfare Stigma, and Food Stamps","This study explores the cash equivalence of food stamps and program-participation-related welfare stigma. The authors clarify important distinctions between cash equivalence in utility and in food demand within the context of the program, and between the program and an alternative cash transfer program. The analysis of program participation suggests that stamps are: nearly cash equivalent in the market goods component of utility; not cash equivalent in the nonmarket components due to welfare stigma; and not cash equivalent in food demand. Stamps increase expenditures on food more than cash by a factor of six to one."," Ranney, Christine KChristineChristine K RanneyRanneyKRanney, Christine K , Kushman, John EJohnJohn E KushmanKushmanEKushman, John E",http://search.proquest.com/docview/56304451?accountid=14496," General Welfare Programs (9110) , Consumer Economics--Expenditure Patterns and Consumption of Specific Items (9212) , Economics of Poverty (9140) , U.S. , Northern America",EconLit,1987

Ramsey Pricing: A Method for Setting Fees in Social Service Organizations,"Nonprofit social services frequently avoid setting prices because of distributional concerns & incompetence on the part of some consumers. After summarizing arguments for prices & cash transfers vs in-kind subsidies, the effectiveness of ""Ramsey pricing"" (see Zajac, Edward E., Fairness or Efficiency, Cambridge, Mass: Ballinger, 1978) in achieving efficient resource allocation in a zero-profit firm when marginal cost pricing would lead to a profit is investigated. Results of a survey of Canadian social service agencies in southwestern Ontario (N = 34) indicate that none of them uses Ramsey prices -- zero-profit prices for which there is no Pareto superior adjustment; indeed, few use any form of user fees, & exhibit an overall lack of recognition of the economic & theoretical justifications for doing so. Ramsey pricing is offered as a solution. 3 Figures, 16 References.

Predicting the Effects of In-kind Transfers on Labor Supply,"A basic difference between cash transfers and in-kind transfers of identical market value is that the latter ensure that recipient consumption is constrained to include prescribed amounts of targeted commodities. Whether the effect on hours of work is different from that induced by cash depends on the extent to which consumption patterns differ from those which would have been selected had the transfer been monetary, and the complementarity of transferred commodities with leisure. A linear, logarithmic demand system is used to simulate differing labor-supply responses to cash, housing, and food transfers."," Leonesio, Michael VMichaelMichael V LeonesioLeonesioVLeonesio, Michael V",http://search.proquest.com/docview/56357837?accountid=14496," Labor Economics: Theory and Empirical Studies Illustrating Theory (8210) , General Welfare Programs (9110) , U.S. , Northern America",EconLit,1988
In-Kind Transfers and Work Incentives,"Recent developments in rationing theory are used to examine the differences between the effects of in-kind and cash transfers on labor supply. It is not possible to tell a priori which type of transfer will cause the greater reduction in hours of work; the answer depends on the extent to which in-kind transfers distort consumption choices and on the relationship between the transferred commodities and leisure. Hicks-Allen complements can cause greater reductions in labor supply than equally generous cash transfers, while strong Hicks-Allen substitutes can induce increases in market work."," Leonesio, Michael VMichaelMichael V LeonesioLeonesioVLeonesio, Michael V",http://search.proquest.com/docview/56373322?accountid=14496," Labor Economics: Theory and Empirical Studies Illustrating Theory (8210) , General Welfare Programs (9110)",EconLit,1988
Seniority and Distribution in a Two-Worker Trade Union,"Unlike existing models that rely heavily on assumption regarding unions' distributional preferences, the authors present a simple model in which union seniority-layoff rules and rising seniority-wage profiles result from optimal price discrimination against the firm. Surprisingly, even when cash transfers among union members are ruled out, unions' optimal seniority-wage profiles are likely to be completely unaffected by their distributional preferences because of a kink in the utility-possibility frontier. This suggests that the simple technology of price discrimination may play a key role, hitherto unappreciated, in explaining union policies that affect the relative well-being of different union members."," Kuhn, PeterMcMaster UU W OntarioPeterPeter KuhnKuhnKuhn, Peter , Robert, JacquesJacquesJacques RobertRobertRobert, Jacques",http://search.proquest.com/docview/56411199?accountid=14496," Labor Economics: Theory and Empirical Studies Illustrating Theory (8210) , Trade Unions (8310)",EconLit,1989

When the Baby Boom Grows Old: Impacts on Canada's Public Sector,"Canada, like many other countries, is experiencing a significant aging of its population. This trend is expected to increase the ""burden"" on the public sector of major cash transfer and in-kind benefit programmes. The estimated size of the burden depends on projections of demographic change, economic growth, and structural aspects of the major age-sensitive public-sector programmes. The burdens are analysed for 2016 and 2036, the period when demographic aging may be expected to have its most adverse impacts on old-age dependency ratios and public-sector programme costs. Contrary to many popularly expressed concerns, demographic aging is not the most important factor in determining future public-sector costs and revenues. Rather, aspects of the design and management of public-sector programmes represent the greatest area of uncertainty. These areas are more amenable to public policy initiatives and gradual adjustments within the half century time-frame of the projections."," Murphy, Brian BStatistics CanadaStatistics CanadaBrianBrian B MurphyMurphyBMurphy, Brian B , Wolfson, Michael CMichaelMichael C WolfsonWolfsonCWolfson, Michael C",http://search.proquest.com/docview/56533731?accountid=14496," Demographic Trends, Macroeconomic Effects, and Forecasts (J11) , National Government Expenditures and Health (H51) , Social Security and Public Pensions (H55) , Canada , Northern America , Baby Boom , Demographics , Population",EconLit,1991

Who Pays? Receipt of Child Support in the United States,"Data from 673 ever-divorced mothers from the National Longitudinal Study of the High School Class of 1972 with regard to receipt of child support suggest that the primary factors influencing child support payments are the structure of the divorce settlement & fathers' circumstances, eg, income, marital status, physical proximity, & child visitation. Receipt of child support is influenced more by absent fathers' motivation to provide cash transfers, & less by circumstances of mothers & children. It is also found that amount of child support received is a function of the amount of child support awarded & whether any support was received. 3 Tables, 31 References. S.

Lifetime vs Annual Tax-Transfer Incidence: How Much Less Progressive?,"Annual fiscal incidence studies have found that income taxes and cash transfers are highly progressive and that their net effect is to redistribute income from rich to poor. Yet many argue that such studies overstate the redistribution achieved by governments and that lifetime analysis is needed. New results suggest that both income taxes and cash transfers are progressive on a lifetime basis, although they are much less progressive than annual studies suggest.

Preface,"Among the social sciences, economics is the only discipline that receives a Nobel Prize. Explored here is the merit of awarding the 1992 Nobel to Gary Becker for ""having extended the domain of economic theory to aspects of human behavior which had previously been dealt with -- if at all -- by other social science disciplines, such as sociology, demography, & criminology."" Becker's application of economics to the study of discrimination, education, crime, & the family is argued to reduce complex social relations to mere cash transfers & pay too little attention to the form & impact of institutions. Nevertheless, sociologists will benefit from Becker's insight if they recognize that the acknowledgement of a rational component of individual decision making need not mean giving up on irrational & nonrational elements. It is in this way that interdisciplinary studies can prove fruitful. M.

Separate Spheres Bargaining and the Marriage Market,"This paper introduces the 'separate spheres' bargaining model, a new model of distribution within marriage. It differs from divorce threat bargaining models in that the threat point is not divorce but a noncooperative equilibrium within marriage; this noncooperative equilibrium reflects traditional gender roles. The predictions of the authors' model thus differ from those of divorce threat bargaining models; in the separate spheres model, cash transfer payments to the mother and payments to the father can--but need not--imply different equilibrium distributions in existing marriages. In the long run, the distributional effects of transfer policies may be substantially altered by changes in the marriage market equilibrium."," Lundberg, ShellyU WAU WAShellyShelly LundbergLundbergLundberg, Shelly , Pollak, Robert ARobertRobert A PollakPollakAPollak, Robert A",http://search.proquest.com/docview/56600317?accountid=14496," Fertility, Family Planning, Child Care, Children, Youth (J13) , Mothers",EconLit,1993
Private Agencies as Public Agents? Developments in Child Welfare in New South Wales,"The number of children in the care of New South Wales government institutions has been decreasing, especially among children in state institutions as compared with those in state-organized foster care. Overall, government expenditure on substitute care has also fallen, although cash transfers to private child welfare agencies for the provision of alternative substitute care have increased markedly. Plans to transfer remaining state substitute-care services to the private sector are accompanied by introduction of greater measures of control. Privatization & tighter regulation of substitute-care services reflect wider trends in the Australian welfare state. 1 Table.

Pecuniary Redistribution through In-Kind Programs,"The pecuniary effects of cash and in-kind programs differ. A program that builds housing for the poor, for example, is likely to result in a lower price of existing low-income housing than would an equally costly cash transfer program. Low-income renters in general would benefit; landlords would lose. This paper argues that these pecuniary effects provide a previously unstudied rationale for the use of in-kind programs. Specifically, in a world in which the government has limited ability to target taxation, the pecuniary effects of in-kind programs may be used to transfer rents from one group in society to another. The pros and cons of using in-kind programs in this way are identified and examples from the real world are discussed."," Coate, StephenU PAHarvard UHarvard UStephenStephen CoateCoateCoate, Stephen , Johnson, StephenStephenStephen JohnsonJohnsonJohnson, Stephen , Zeckhauser, RichardRichardRichard ZeckhauserZeckhauserZeckhauser, Richard",http://search.proquest.com/docview/56648897?accountid=14496," Taxation and Subsidies: Externalities, Redistributive Effects, Environmental Taxes and Subsidies (H23) , Welfare, Well-Being, and Poverty: Government Programs, Provision and Effects of Welfare Programs (I38) , Redistribution , Transfers",EconLit,1994
"In-Kind Transfers, Cash Grants and Labor Supply","In-kind cash transfer programs are compared in their impacts on labor supply. It is demonstrated that labor supply is higher under an in-kind transfer program, if in-kind transfers and leisure are Hicks substitutes, leisure is normal, and in-kind transfers are 'over-provided.' It is further shown that under these conditions a one dollar increase in in-kind coupled with a one dollar cut in cash transfers increases tax revenues. Finally, the paper proves that weak separability of preferences between leisure and other goods, in addition to normality of leisure and normality and over-provision of in-kind transfers, is also sufficient to ensure a higher level of labor supply under in-kind transfers."," Gahvari, FirouzU IL and VA Polytechnic Institute & State UFirouzFirouz GahvariGahvariGahvari, Firouz",http://search.proquest.com/docview/56649798?accountid=14496," Time Allocation and Labor Supply (J22) , Taxation and Subsidies: Externalities, Redistributive Effects, Environmental Taxes and Subsidies (H23) , Fiscal Policies and Behavior of Economic Agents: Household (H31) , Nonwage Labor Costs and Benefits, Retirement Plans, Private Pensions (J32) , Labor Supply , Revenue , Tax",EconLit,1994
Antipoverty Effects of Public Income Transfers on Children,"US census data, 1979-1991, are used to examine the distributive effects of non-means-tested cash & noncash public transfer programs in reducing poverty among children. Data are analyzed for white, black, & Hispanic children, separately, as well as for the elderly. Findings indicate that children heavily depend on means-tested noncash transfers in preventing poverty, whereas the elderly depend heavily on non-means-tested cash transfers.

In-Kind versus Cash Transfers in the Presence of Distortionary Taxes,"In-kind transfers can Pareto-dominate cash transfers as a means of income redistribution if in-kind transfers and leisure are Hicks substitutes and leisure is a normal good. The result holds when redistributive instruments also include a linear income tax. The paper proves that, if the poor receive more in-kind transfers (and the rich less) than what they would choose for themselves, then, compared to cash transfers, there will be a higher labor supply by the poor, a lower labor supply by the rich, and higher levels of aggregate pretax income and tax revenues."," Gahvari, FirouzU IL and VA Polytechnic Institute & State UFirouzFirouz GahvariGahvariGahvari, Firouz",http://search.proquest.com/docview/56638018?accountid=14496," Taxation and Subsidies: Externalities, Redistributive Effects, Environmental Taxes and Subsidies (H23) , Welfare, Well-Being, and Poverty: Government Programs, Provision and Effects of Welfare Programs (I38) , Fiscal Policies and Behavior of Economic Agents: Household (H31) , Redistribution , Tax , Taxes , Transfers",EconLit,1995
"Cash vs. Kind, Self-Selection, and Public Support for Child Rearing","Many governments around the world implement, for different reasons, policies meant to support child rearing. This paper examines the relative merits of the two most popular ways of realising this, i.e. cash transfers and in-kind transfers. More specifically, we ask whether these interventions may lead to Pareto-improvements in the presence of a constrained Pareto-efficient general income tax. The answer is that, under weak conditions, in-kind transfers (targeted on the low-income groups) are Pareto-improving, while cash transfers are not. This reinforces known results on in-kind transfers, showing that they are not only useful for supplementing monetary policy tools, but that they should entirely replace some of them."," Balestrino, AlessandroU PisaAlessandroAlessandro BalestrinoBalestrinoBalestrino, Alessandro",http://search.proquest.com/docview/56677510?accountid=14496," Fertility, Family Planning, Child Care, Children, Youth (J13) , Welfare, Well-Being, and Poverty: Government Programs, Provision and Effects of Welfare Programs (I38) , Demographic Economics: Public Policy (J18) , Child , Transfers",EconLit,1995
"Housing Reform in Urban China: Efficiency, Distribution and the Implications for Social Security","The authors investigate the distribution of a measure of housing consumption among public tenants in cities of two Chinese provinces using household survey data. They find the resulting distribution roughly consistent with the outcome of a market rental system for fixed supply and CES preferences. There is surprisingly little evidence of allocative inefficiency in the present bureaucratic allocation system. The authors estimate the possible effects of market-oriented housing reform. Under alternative assumptions about the system of cash transfers used to compensate for a move to market rents, they investigate the distributional impact of reform and the likely need for supplementary cash benefits for low-income households."," Pudney, StephenU LeicesterU KentStephenStephen PudneyPudneyPudney, Stephen , Wang, LiminLiminLimin WangWangWang, Limin",http://search.proquest.com/docview/56627976?accountid=14496," Housing Supply and Markets (R31) , Urban, Rural, Regional, Real Estate, and Transportation Economics: Housing Demand (R21) , China , Asia , Housing , Tenant",EconLit,1995

The Effect of Food Stamp Cashout on Food Expenditures: An Assessment of the Findings from Four Demonstrations,"Using findings from four demonstrations, we examine estimates of the effect on household food expenditures of converting food stamps into a cash transfer. We provide arguments for why the estimate produced by one of the demonstrations should be regarded as an outlier. The disparity in the difference-in-means estimates from the remaining three demonstrations is reduced when each is normalized by dividing by the average value of benefits in the respective demonstration site. The normalized estimates imply a reduction in food expenditures of between 18 and 28 cents for each dollar of food stamps cashed out. At the aggregate level, these estimates imply that nationwide cashout would result in a reduction in household food spending of between 4.2 and 6.5 billion dollars, whereas the associated reduction in the cost of administering the Food Stamp Program would be about 0.3 billion dollars."," Fraker, Thomas MMathematica Policy Research IncUrban InstituteMathematica Policy Research IncThomasThomas M FrakerFrakerMFraker, Thomas M , Martini, Alberto PAlbertoAlberto P MartiniMartiniPMartini, Alberto P , Ohls, James CJamesJames C OhlsOhlsCOhls, James C",http://search.proquest.com/docview/56696142?accountid=14496," Welfare, Well-Being, and Poverty: Government Programs, Provision and Effects of Welfare Programs (I38) , Consumer Economics: Empirical Analysis (D12) , National Government Expenditures and Welfare Programs (H53) , U.S. , Northern America , Expenditure , Food Stamp , Households , Transfers",EconLit,1995
Poverty and Poverty Alleviation Programmes in the Urban Areas of Mozambique,"In Mozambique's urban centers, 50+% of households live in poverty. Within this group, destitute (vs absolutely poor) households (33% of the population) have expenditures less than 66% of the poverty line, are at risk of malnutrition, & have high infant mortality & low life expectancy. Appropriate interventions for these households should be based on distinctions between structural (eg, unemployability) & conjunctural (eg, underemployment) causes of poverty. Existing programs for poverty reduction -- both those to create employment & generate income, & social safety net programs -- are reviewed, arguing that the only one judged to have had significant impact in alleviating poverty & destitution is the Gabinete de Apoio a Populacao Vulneravel (Ministry of Assistance for Vulnerable Populations) Cash Transfer Scheme. It has succeeded in reaching increasing numbers of vulnerable, destitute households because of its use of both horizontal & vertical targeting, decentralized health & community administration structures, & strong political & institutional backing. 7 Tables, 3 Figures.

The Welfare Effects of Raising Household Energy Prices in Poland,"We examine the welfare effects from increasing household energy prices in Poland. Subsidizing household energy prices, common in the transition economies, is shown to be highly regressive. The wealthy spend a larger portion of their income on energy and consume more energy in absolute terms. We therefore rule out the oft-used social welfare arguments for delaying household energy price increases. Raising prices, while targeting relief to the poor through a social assistance program, is the first-best response. However, if governments want to ease the adjustment, several options are open, including: in-kind transfers to the poor, vouchers, in-cash transfers, and lifeline pricing for electricity. Our simulations show that if raising prices to efficient levels is not politically feasible at present and social assistance targeting is sufficiently weak, it may be socially better to use lifeline pricing and a large price increase than an overall, but smaller, price increase."," Freund, Caroline LColumbia UWorld BankCarolineCaroline L FreundFreundLFreund, Caroline L , Wallich, Christine IChristineChristine I WallichWallichIWallich, Christine I",http://search.proquest.com/docview/56683344?accountid=14496," Energy: Demand and Supply, Prices (Q41) , Poland , Europe , Energy",EconLit,1996
Labour Market Policies in Transition Economies,"Examines the effectiveness of labor market-based welfare-enhancing programs & the impact of welfare-oriented interventions such as transfers on the labor market in the transition economies of the formerly communist states of East/Central Europe. Using data gathered by international organizations & secondary sources, it is suggested that active labor efforts -- eg, retraining programs, job-search assistance, & wage subsidies -- have not been very effective in this region. Further, these economies have much higher payroll tax rates & provide more cash transfers than are warranted given their income levels. However, the use of pilot programs that are rigorously evaluated & then employed as models for more precisely targeted programs may be a more promising labor-oriented strategy. Moreover, it is asserted that a better designed system of cash transfers that reduces payroll taxes, socializes severance pay financing, & simplifies unemployment benefits will improve the trade-offs associated with transfer burdens. 4 Tables, 3 Figures, 19 References.

From Basic Needs to Safety-Nets: The Rise and Fall of Urban Food-Rationing in Mozambique,"This study traces the relationship between strategies of development and the organisation of urban food distribution in Maputo, Mozambique. It argues that general price subsidies and rationing promoted social equity in the socialist period and that the targeted cash-transfer scheme instituted with Structural Adjustment was a token measure motivated by political considerations. It suggests, however, that one cannot draw general conclusions about the social equity implications of either general subsidies or tightly targeted welfare measures. Their effectiveness depends on the overall distribution of income, macroeconomic policies, political context, and corresponding moral climate. The weakness of the income-transfer scheme derives from its imbedding in a strategy of liberalisation that does not adequately confront the complex causes of pervasive poverty in Mozambique."," O'Laughlin, BridgetInstitute of Social Studies, HagueBridgetBridget O'LaughlinO'LaughlinO'Laughlin, Bridget",http://search.proquest.com/docview/56711979?accountid=14496," Economic Development: Human Resources, Human Development, Income Distribution, Migration (O15) , Welfare, Well-Being, and Poverty: Government Programs, Provision and Effects of Welfare Programs (I38) , Agricultural Policy, Food Policy (Q18) , Mozambique , Africa , Development , Distribution , Safety Net , Subsidies , Transfers , Welfare",EconLit,1996

Indicators of Housing Finance Intergenerational Wealth Transfers,"This paper sheds light on intrafamilial gifts for housing. By using Austrian intergenerational survey data various questions are addressed. First, is familial aid more or less widespread in given social strata? Second, what are the determinants and motives for family gifts? And third, what are the possible impacts on the choice set of their recipients? Probit estimates show that gifts significantly depend on the parents lifetime financial position, consistent with life cycle permanent income (LCPI) approaches. Gifts to remove liquidity constraints are more difficult to reconcile with LCPI. ""Dynastic"" gifts that support household information and ownership acquisition may be interpreted as intergenerational exchange.

Choosing Among Alternative Programs for Poor Children,"Examines the problems in determining the effectiveness of child poverty programs, & suggests the criteria of efficiency, positive return on investment, positive incentives, & equity as tools for evaluation. The current body of knowledge regarding the effectiveness of aid programs is described & evaluated with the four criteria, focusing on cash-transfer & in-kind programs for housing, nutrition, early education, & health care. Difficulties in evaluating & choosing between these programs are discussed. Although there is little research on outcomes of cash-transfer programs, positive outcomes have been seen for in-kind programs, & they have been given more emphasis.

"The Suffering Middle: Trends in Income Inequality in Australia, 1982 to 1993-94","This article analyses labour force trends, household composition and income inequality between 1982 and 1993-94, principally using unit record tapes for the two years produced by the Australian Bureau of Statistics. The results suggest that earnings and private income inequality increased during these 11 years. However, increasing progressivity in the income tax and, in particular, the government cash transfer system fully offset this growing market-based inequality. Summary inequality measures thus suggest that the distribution of disposable (post-tax/transfer) and equivalent disposable income was much the same in 1993-94 as in 1982. However, this apparent stability disguised real income gains at the top and bottom of the income spectrum and losses for the middle 50 per cent of Australians."," Harding, AnnNational Centre for Social & Econ Modelling, U CanberraAnnAnn HardingHardingHarding, Ann",http://search.proquest.com/docview/56798306?accountid=14496," Personal Income, Wealth, and Their Distributions (D31) , Fiscal Policies and Behavior of Economic Agents: Household (H31) , Australia , Oceania , Distribution , Income , Inequality",EconLit,1997
The Impact of the CHST on Interprovincial Redistribution in Canada,"In 1996, transfers made under Established Programs Financing and the Canada Assistance Plan were replaced with the Canada Health and Social Transfer (CHST). This paper examines the impact of the CHST on the net redistribution of revenues across provinces in its first few years of operation. The results show that, while the CHST alters recent trends in net redistribution, the effects are modest when compared to the impacts of earlier measures such as the freeze in per capita EPF entitlements and the ""cap on CAP,"" imposed in 1990. The federal government's recent decision to raise the CHST cash floor further reduces the CHST's effect on redistribution relative to the status quo as does the decision to adjust the allocation of the CHST slowly (rather than immediately) in the direction of equal per capita shares. Finally, the distinction between cash transfers and entitlements is important when measuring net redistribution from federal transfers to provinces."," Snoddon, Tracy RWilfrid Laurier UTracyTracy R SnoddonSnoddonRSnoddon, Tracy R",http://search.proquest.com/docview/56791089?accountid=14496," Taxation and Subsidies: Externalities, Redistributive Effects, Environmental Taxes and Subsidies (H23) , Intergovernmental Relations, Federalism, Secession (H77) , Canada , Northern America , Redistribution , Revenue",EconLit,1998

Agricultural Policies in the Presence of Distorting Taxes,"This article analyzes how distortionary factor taxes affect the welfare impacts of production subsidies, production quotas, acreage controls, subsidies for acreage reductions, and cash transfers to farmers. Preexisting taxes substantially raise the costs of all these policies. These additional costs reflect the welfare losses from financing certain policies by distortionary taxes. They also reflect interactions with factor markets caused by changes in the costs of producing agricultural output. Previous studies ignore the latter types of effect.

Focus is on the effects of wage rates & parental characteristics on the allocation decisions of adult children & their households concerning these four demands. It is found that households with individuals earning high wages rely relatively more on cash transfers & relatively less on time transfers than do lower-wage households.

The Desirability of In-Kind Transfers in the Presence of Distortionary Taxes,"A standard argument in welfare economics maintains that private goods should not be publicly provided, because cash transfers are always superior to in-kind transfers. However, this conclusion does not hold in second best economies. A strong case for the desirability of in-kind transfer in the presence of distortionary taxes has been made in various recent contributions. Here, we survey the arguments provided in these papers, using a common theoretical framework which enables us to present more clearly the similarities and the differences among the various papers. The use of a common formal model helps us to show how the rationale for public provision of private goods is sensitive to the form of the tax system. It also helps us to provide an explanation why mandatory and non-mandatory in-kind transfer schemes have the same effects on social welfare. Finally, we offer some considerations on the relevance of the theory of in-kind transfers for policy action."," Balestrino, AlessandroU PisaAlessandroAlessandro BalestrinoBalestrinoBalestrino, Alessandro",http://search.proquest.com/docview/56848576?accountid=14496," Taxation and Subsidies: Externalities, Redistributive Effects, Environmental Taxes and Subsidies (H23) , Publicly Provided Private Goods (H42) , Fiscal Policies and Behavior of Economic Agents: Household (H31) , Welfare, Well-Being, and Poverty: Government Programs, Provision and Effects of Welfare Programs (I38) , Taxes , Transfers , Welfare",EconLit,1999

Health Care and Economic Well-Being: Estimating Equivalence Scales for Public Health Care Utilization,"Inconsistency between the income concept and the needs associated with its use can yield seriously misleading welfare assessments in comparisons concerning different household types. Equivalence scales are typically estimated from expenditure data that make them compatible with welfare adjustments involving cash income. However, if the welfare analysis extends to economic benefits other than cash income, the equivalence scale must be adjusted to account for needs relevant to the particular form of benefit. This paper derives needs-based equivalence scales for public health care utilization. The scales are estimated from the health care utilization data of different services. In addition, redistributional analysis is used to investigate the effects of adopting various income concepts and allowing for health care needs in the equivalence scale. The results clearly reveal the conceptual importance of accounting for health status, household size and age in welfare comparisons concerning non-cash transfers. It is also shown that the redistributive effect of public health care is heavily dependent upon assumptions made about its scope."," Klavus, JanSTAKES, National R&D Center for Welfare & Health, HelsinkiJanJan KlavusKlavusKlavus, Jan",http://search.proquest.com/docview/56929067?accountid=14496," Health: Government Policy, Regulation, Public Health (I18) , Analysis of Health Care Markets (I11) , National Government Expenditures and Health (H51) , Finland , Europe , Expenditure , Health Care , Health , Public Health",EconLit,1999
"The State, the Child, and Imperfect Parenting","Considers state interventions in families on behalf of children whose parents are negligent. The state faces an agency problem when it intervenes on behalf of neglected children, because it cannot fully monitor families; ie, it can give cash transfers to poor parents, but it cannot observe them & make sure that they spend the money on their children. Consideration of this agency problem leads to three additional considerations: (1) legislators have preferred giving in-kind benefits, rather than income transfers, to negligent parents; (2) society benefits economically from maintaining alternatives to the traditional family, eg, foster homes; & (3) parents neglect their children because they prefer their own consumption over that of their children. 3 Tables, 3 Figures, 22 References.

Revisiting Real Social Spending across Countries: A Brief Note,"This brief note updates indicators on net social spending which provide a more comparable view of social benefits across countries (see Economic Studies, No. 28). The note describes the effects of adjusting standard data on budgetary allocations for social purposes by accounting for taxation of cash transfers, indirect taxation of consumption out of benefits and tax breaks for social purposes. The country coverage is expanded to cover thirteen countries: Australia, Belgium, Canada, Denmark, Finland, Germany, Ireland, Italy, the Netherlands, Norway, Sweden, the United Kingdom and the United States, while the notion of social spending has been enriched to also cover voluntary social spending by the private sector. Considering social spending within such a comprehensive framework leads to a marked convergence of social expenditure levels across countries."," Adema, WillemOECDWillemWillem AdemaAdemaAdema, Willem",http://search.proquest.com/docview/56994219?accountid=14496," National Government Expenditures and Welfare Programs (H53) , Social Security and Public Pensions (H55) , Personal Income and Other Nonbusiness Taxes and Subsidies, includes inheritance and gift taxes (H24) , Selected Countries , Tax , Taxation",EconLit,2000
Un analisis de la pobreza en el sector ejidal mexicano. (An Analysis of Poverty in the Mexican Ejido Sector. With English summary.),"This paper uses two national surveys of the ejido sector to analyze households' responses to the reforms that affected this sector between 1994 and 1997. Results show that the period was not favorable to incomes derived from agriculture as a consequence of both low incentives and decline in institutional support to productivity. The reforms have induced households to seek income strategies with increasing reliance on off-farm activities, particularly self-employment in non-agricultural activities and migration to the United States. Educational levels and locational advantages have been key in explaining why some households have been better able to take advantage of non-agricultural employment opportunities than others. PROCAMPO has been quite effective in protecting household incomes from the decline in agricultural incomes. Cash transfers received through this program have generated large income multipliers as they have been used to acquire inputs otherwise constrained by lack of access to credit."," Davis, BenjaminIFPRIBenjaminBenjamin DavisDavisDavis, Benjamin",http://search.proquest.com/docview/56898143?accountid=14496," Measurement and Analysis of Poverty (I32) , Economic Development: Human Resources, Human Development, Income Distribution, Migration (O15) , Time Allocation and Labor Supply (J22) , International Migration (F22) , Mexico , Latin America and the Caribbean , Migration , Poverty",EconLit,2000

Social Insurance with In-Kind Provision of Private Goods,"This paper addresses the desirability of providing in-kind transfers as a screening device to facilitate redistribution of income from able to disabled persons within a social insurance system. An optimal policy--consisting of cash transfers, income-contingent in-kind transfers of one good particularly demanded by disabled workers, and linear taxation of other commodities--is characterized. It is then asked whether and, if so, when this policy can be replaced by an ""earning-tested scheme"" that provides the in-kind good only to those individuals who have no earnings from labor or by a non-linear pricing policy."," Anderberg, DanHeriot-Watt UDanDan AnderbergAnderbergAnderberg, Dan",http://search.proquest.com/docview/56096116?accountid=14496," Welfare, Well-Being, and Poverty: Government Programs, Provision and Effects of Welfare Programs (I38) , Publicly Provided Private Goods (H42) , Health: Government Policy, Regulation, Public Health (I18) , National Government Expenditures and Health (H51) , Policy , Transfers",EconLit,2001
Cash Transfer Programs with Income Multipliers: PROCAMPO in Mexico,"Cash transfer programs create multiplier effects when recipients put the money they receive to work to generate further incomes. When this is the case, the ultimate income effects are multiples of the amounts transferred. We analyze the PROCAMPO program in Mexico that was introduced to compensate farmers for the anticipated negative effect of NAFTA on the prices of basic crops. The transfer rules and the timing of the panel data collected allow unique control of biases in this impact analysis. We find that the multiplier among ejido sector recipients is in the range 1.5-2.6. Multipliers are higher for households with medium and large farms, low numbers of adults in the household, nonindigenous backgrounds, and located in the Center and Gulf regions. High multipliers reflect income opportunities that had remained unrealized due to liquidity constraints that are relaxed by the transfers. Opportunities come from the asset endowments that these households received through the land reform, particularly irrigated land, and they are enhanced by access to technical assistance."," Sadoulet, ElisabethU CA, BerkeleyU CA, BerkeleyFood & Agriculture Organization, RomeElisabethElisabeth SadouletSadouletSadoulet, Elisabeth , de Janvry, AlainAlainAlain de Janvryde Janvryde Janvry, Alain , Davis, BenjaminBenjaminBenjamin DavisDavisDavis, Benjamin",http://search.proquest.com/docview/56997731?accountid=14496," Agricultural Policy, Food Policy (Q18) , Welfare, Well-Being, and Poverty: Government Programs, Provision and Effects of Welfare Programs (I38) , Economic Development: Agriculture, Natural Resources, Energy, Environment, Other Primary Products (O13) , Economic Development: Human Resources, Human Development, Income Distribution, Migration (O15) , Economic Integration (F15) , Mexico , Latin America and the Caribbean , Farmers , NAFTA , Transfers",EconLit,2001
Do Agricultural Programs in Mexico Alleviate Poverty? Evidence from the Ejido Sector,"Following the economic and legal reforms of the early 1990s, the Government of Mexico has developed new agricultural support programs that promote productivity and facilitate the adjustment process, while not interfering with the market economy put into place by the reforms. In this paper, we use a panel survey for the ejido sector for the years 1994 and 1997 to analyze the impact on poverty of two programs: PROCAMPO, a cash transfer per hectare of cultivated land, and ALIANZA, a matching grant program for investments in agriculture. Our evaluation method takes into account the endogeneity of placement. We find that participation in PROCAMPO significantly reduces the likelihood that a ejido household will be poor, but that ALIANZA has no significant impact on poverty. It is also shown that PROCAMPO may have a positive multiplier effect on household income."," Cord, LouiseWorld BankWorld BankLouiseLouise CordCordCord, Louise , Wodon, QuentinQuentinQuentin WodonWodonWodon, Quentin",http://search.proquest.com/docview/56995979?accountid=14496," Economic Development: Agriculture, Natural Resources, Energy, Environment, Other Primary Products (O13) , Measurement and Analysis of Poverty (I32) , Agricultural Policy, Food Policy (Q18) , Mexico , Latin America and the Caribbean",EconLit,2001

"Immigrants, Natives and Social Assistance: Comparable Take-Up under Comparable Circumstances","Are immigrants on welfare because they are more likely to be eligible or because they are more likely to claim benefits for which they are eligible? The answer is politically important, but because most current research on immigration & welfare is based on data from the US, the answer is difficult due to the complexities of the transfer system that make eligibility determinations difficult. In Germany, by contrast, eligibility for the main cash transfer program, Sozialhilfe (social assistance), is determined by a comparatively simple nationwide formula. We use data from the German Socioeconomic Panel to test whether immigrants to Germany are more likely than natives to claim welfare benefits for which they are eligible. We find that immigrants are more likely than native Germans to receive welfare, both because immigrants are more likely to be eligible & because they are more likely, when eligible, to claim their benefits. However, we also find that this greater propensity to claim benefits is not related to immigrant status per se: when other sociodemographic factors are accounted for in an appropriate manner, immigrant households are no more likely to claim benefits than native households. 5 Tables, 1 Appendix, 29 References.

The 25-year legislative history of EITC is summarized & differences in knowledge are explored across four divisions: state of residence; income/welfare participation; marriage/education; & race/ethnicity/citizenship. Although two-thirds of all parents have heard about EITC, low-income Hispanic parents are significantly less likely to know about the program than low-income non-Hispanic parents of any race. Hispanics are also the least likely among low-income parents to have any knowledge about EITC or to have received the tax credit. Past welfare recipients are more likely to be aware of the program than current recipients or those who have never received welfare benefits. It was also found that low-income parents residing in states with state-level EITC programs were not more likely to know about the national program. 4 Tables, 2 Figures. J.

The Political Viability of a Negative Income Tax,"This paper offers three propositions relating to the political viability of the negative income tax. One, despite its work disincentive, a majority of households would support a linear income tax that makes cash payments to low-income households. Two, when government consumption is sufficiently high, a majority would favor a proportional tax over such a tax. Three, under certain conditions, a majority of households will prefer public provisions of a private good or an in-kind transfer to a negative income tax. These latter two propositions offer an explanation for the public's apparent distaste for widespread cash transfers. 18 References.

Using a tax-benefit microsimulation model and the 1998 micro data of the Bank of Italy survey of household income and wealth, we first study the distributional effects of the current Italian income maintenance system and highlight its main defects and limitations, concerning in particular its unequal coverage of the population and its low efficiency in fighting poverty. The second aim is to describe and analyse the reforms recently implemented in this field. In particular, the Italian government has reformed the targeting criteria and introduced three new cash transfers.

Nash equilibria may be either symmetric with agents matching one another's provision or else asymmetric with an in-kind transfer by one agent to another. An equilibrium with cash transfers, but no in-kind transfers, may be Pareto superior to one with only in-kind transfers.

Grandmothers and Granddaughters: Old-Age Pensions and Intrahousehold Allocation in South Africa,This article evaluates the impact of a large cash transfer program in South Africa on children's nutritional status and investigates whether the gender of the recipient affects that impact. In the early 1990s the benefits and coverage of the South African social pension program were expanded for the black population. In 1993 the benefits were about twice the median per capita income in rural areas. More than a quarter of black South African children under age five live with a pension recipient. Estimates suggest that pensions received by women had a large impact on the anthropometric status (weight for height and height for age) of girls but little effect on that of boys. No similar effect is found for pensions received by men.

Public Policy and Extended Families: Evidence from Pensions in South Africa,"How are resources allocated within extended families in developing economies? This question is investigated using a unique social experiment: the South African pension program. Under that program the elderly receive a cash transfer equal to roughly twice the per capita income of Africans in South Africa. The study examines how this transfer affects the labor supply of prime-age individuals living with these elderly in extended families. It finds a sharp drop in the working hours of prime-age individuals in these households when women turn 60 years old or men turn 65, the ages at which they become eligible for pensions. It also finds that the drop in labor supply is much larger when the pensioner is a woman, suggesting an imperfect pooling of resources. The allocation of resources among prime-age individuals depends strongly on their absolute age and gender as well as on their relative age. The oldest son in the household reduces his working hours more than any other prime-age household member."," Bertrand, MarianneU ChicagoMITU CA, DavisMarianneMarianne BertrandBertrandBertrand, Marianne , Mullainathan, SendhilSendhilSendhil MullainathanMullainathanMullainathan, Sendhil , Miller, DouglasDouglasDouglas MillerMillerMiller, Douglas",http://search.proquest.com/docview/56132752?accountid=14496," Household Production and Intrahousehold Allocation (D13) , Economic Development: Human Resources, Human Development, Income Distribution, Migration (O15) , Social Security and Public Pensions (H55) , South Africa , Africa , Elderly , Pension , Policy",EconLit,2003

"Explaining State-Level Variations in Levels and Change in the Distribution of Income in the United States, 1978-1990","Income concentrations increased markedly in the United States during the period since 1980. Income concentrations occurred within states at differing levels & rates. We estimate models that explain variations in levels of income concentration among states in 1980 & 1990 & of changes in state-level income concentration during the period 1978 to 1990. We test for the effects of state & national government redistributive policies along with a number of states' economic, demographic, & political characteristics linked to income distribution in previous research. Results show state-borne redistributive policies have little influence on income concentration. Where state policies do affect income concentration, more generous welfare programs have the unexpected effect of coinciding with increases in income concentration. Higher cash transfers are associated with increased income inequality. Only the establishment of payment standards comparable to the retail wage, a welfare policy enacted by a few states, is associated with reduced income inequality. 2 Tables, 2 Figures, 1 Appendix, 41 References.

Despite over a decade of rapid economic growth and poverty reduction, approximately 40% of Vietnam's population is below or just above the poverty line and is highly vulnerable to community-wide and household-specific shocks. Yet Vietnam's social protection budget has largely financed formal entitlement programs that are failing to deliver substantial reductions in vulnerability for this broad spectrum of the rural population. This paper outlines the state of social protection in Vietnam and presents an agenda for improving effective coverage rates. It closes by assessing the political and bureaucratic feasibility of social protection reforms in other developing countries."," Fritzen, ScottNational U SingaporeScottScott FritzenFritzenFritzen, Scott",http://search.proquest.com/docview/56573434?accountid=14496," National Government Expenditures and Welfare Programs (H53) , Welfare, Well-Being, and Poverty: Government Programs, Provision and Effects of Welfare Programs (I38) , Economic Development: Human Resources, Human Development, Income Distribution, Migration (O15) , Fiscal and Monetary Policy in Development (O23) , Socialist Institutions and Their Transitions: Public Economics (P35) , Socialist Institutions and Their Transitions: Consumer Economics, Health, Education and Training: Welfare, Income, Wealth, and Poverty (P36) , Selected Countries , Vietnam , Asia , Developing Countries , Population , Poverty , Safety Net , Transfers",EconLit,2003
Securities Transaction Taxes for U.S. Financial Markets,"The Keynesian macroeconomist James Tobin presented an ambitious program for social policy, sketched in the titles of ""It Can be Done! Conquering Poverty in the US by 1976"" (1967), ""On Limiting the Domain of Inequality"" (1970), ""On Improving the Economic Status of the Negro"" (1965), and ""Raising the Incomes of the Poor"" (1968). Tobin advocated means-tested cash transfers (negative income tax), to reduce poverty without interfering with market determination of relative prices (a position shared with Milton Friedman), paired with ""non-market egalitarian distributions of commodities essential to life and citizenship"" (education, food stamps, basic housing). The latter position contrasted with Friedman's Chicago school approach. Tobin's message continues to be relevant for reduction of poverty and inequality. Tobin's approach is contrasted with the neoconservative analysis of the causes of poverty (exemplified by Hermstein and Murray, but going back to Senior and Chadwick's Poor Law Report of 1834) that has been reflected in ""the end of welfare as we know it""."," Pollin, RobertU MACenter for Econ and Policy ResearchUnlistedRobertRobert PollinPollinPollin, Robert , Baker, DeanDeanDean BakerBakerBaker, Dean , Schaberg, MarcMarcMarc SchabergSchabergSchaberg, Marc",http://search.proquest.com/docview/56121290?accountid=14496," International Finance: General (F30) , Contingent Pricing, Futures Pricing, option pricing (G13) , Asset Pricing, Trading Volume, Bond Interest Rates (G12) , U.S. , Northern America , Financial Market , Securities",EconLit,2003
Depasser Bono: Comment rendre l'aide plus efficace. (To Be over Bono: How Make More Efficient the Aid to Development. With English summary.),"Making foreign aid more efficient is a necessary condition to induce donors to increase their contributions. We analyze in this perspective the Mexican Progresa program which had in 2000 an annual budget of one billion US$. Its main objective is to increase the educational achievement of rural children through conditional cash transfers to poor mothers. We show that by targeting and calibrating these transfers on the basis of the risk of not going to school, instead of the current criterion of targeting on poverty, would allow to reach the current result with only 25% of the budget spent. We conclude that each development program should be managed to maximize efficiency in reaching its own specific objective outcome (such as education or health) and that it is the whole portfolio of such programs that must be defined as a poverty reduction strategy."," de Janvry, AlainU CA, BerkeleyU CA, BerkeleyAlainAlain de Janvryde Janvryde Janvry, Alain , Sadoulet, ElisabethElisabethElisabeth SadouletSadouletSadoulet, Elisabeth",http://search.proquest.com/docview/56231244?accountid=14496," Foreign Aid (F35) , Education: Government Policy (I28) , Economic Development: Human Resources, Human Development, Income Distribution, Migration (O15) , International Linkages to Development, Role of International Organizations (O19) , Mexico , Latin America and the Caribbean , Aid , Aids , Development , Foreign Aid , Poor",EconLit,2003
"Mexico's Progresa Program (1997-2000): An Example of Neo-Liberal Poverty Alleviation Programs Concerned with Gender, Human Capital Development, Responsibility and Choice","This paper examines Mexico's Program for Education, Health & Nutrition (Progresa), as an example of neo-liberal trends influencing poverty alleviation initiatives. The stated goal of the program was to break the intergenerational cycles of poverty. This end was to be achieved by investing in the basic capacities of the poor, particularly poor women & their children. Basic capacities were to be developed through cash transfers for improved nutrition, scholarships for children, & preventative health measures. The key concern of this paper, however, is to examine how cash transfers for human capital development are more than instruments of poverty reduction. Rather, cash transfers are also techniques that effect a new way of governing individual conduct. The intended effect of Progresa was a change in the subjectivity of poor women from the passive recipients of aid to empowered market subjects who were now given the freedom to make choices, albeit limited choices. However, subjects could now also be regulated through the choices they make. The Progresa program can be said to represent a government through freedom, which in turn signals a shift from governing through the direct administration of state institutions [read ""passive""] to that of governing through the 'active' & responsible choices of individuals & their families. 45 References.

A constitutional reform of health insurance,"In their contribution Bernd Raffelhschen and Jasmin H_cker point out that by now it is common knowledge that the German Long-term Care Insurance (LTCI) is in urgent need of a broad reform. Without any doubt, two fundamental mistakes have been made from the scretch: First, it was constructed as a pay-as-you-go scheme, despite of the demographic turbulence ahead. Secondly, contributions were drawn from the payroll although the risk of long-term care is definitely not correlated with personal income. Hence, it is essential to revise both mistakes and to bring about a new and sustainable insurance scheme. In their paper they suggest a reasonable transition from the current pay-as-you-go system to a fully funded strategy thereby accounting for the burden each generation is confronted with. With the help of generational accounting they demonstrate that the so called 'Auslaufmodell' achieves a certain intergenerational balance. It is, however, crucial that the reform takes place instantly, otherwise it will never. This is due to the fact that only in the very near future people can not argue that they have paid their dues. Winfried Schm_hl and Heinz Rothgang discuss the consequences of a judgement of Germany's Constitutional Court. In April 2004 it decided that the Social Long-term Care Insurance discriminates families as compared to those without children since the former also contribute to the system by raising children while the latter do not. The court thus asks for an internalisation of the externalities resulting from child raising, i.e. future contributions of the children. Until 2004 the legislator has to reform the financing system respectively. In this article several options to do so are discussed. With respect to five normative criteria the authors conclude that a reduction of contributions for families is inferior to a fixed cash transfer per child financed by a special tax. Gisela F_rber points out that reforming Germany's system of Long-term Care Insurance (LTCI) is necessary for two major reasons: Since 1999, spendings in this pillar of Social Insurance in Germany exceed contributions; in 2003 deficits added up to 700 Million Euro. Demographic changes will even increase the funding gap. Furthermore, Germany's Constitutional Court decided that families are discriminated in the existing pay-as-you-go system, a disadvantage which has to be corrected before end of 2004. The author criticises the Court's argumentation from an economic point of view. She argues that the problem of LCI is not the lack of children but the increase of life expectancy with each year of birth. She therefore proposes to add elements of capital funding within or besides the existing system which helps to overcome the increasing costs. A total abolition of the pay-as-you-use principle however would restrict (limited, but necessary) spaces of redistribution within the LTCI. Furthermore, adult family members of employees should not get free insurance coverage anymore, but pay at least a minimum rate of contribution themselves. Then contributions for family members during a certain period of education might be subsidised by tax revenue.

Taxes and the Labor Market Participation of Married Couples: The Earned Income Tax Credit,"A distinguishing feature of recent changes to the US system of public assistance is its increasing focus on working families and reliance on the tax system to transfer dollars to needy families. After a decade in near total obscurity, the earned income tax credit (EITC) was expanded to become the largest cash-transfer program for lower-income families with children. Advocates of the EITC argue that, unlike traditional welfare, the credit helps ""promote both the values of family and work"". Indeed, empirical evidence consistent with economic theory suggests that the EITC promotes employment among eligible unmarried women with children. To target benefits to lower-income families, however, the EITC is based on family income, leading to traditional welfare-type disincentives for most eligible secondary earners. In fact, the EITC is likely to reduce overall family labor supply among married couples. This paper examines the labor force participation response of married couples to EITC expansions between 1984 and 1996. The effect of the credit is estimated using both quasi-experimental and traditional reduced-form labor supply models. Results from both models show the same qualitative conclusion, that the EITC expansions reduced total family labor supply of married couples. In all cases, we find a decline in labor force participation by married women that more than offsets any rise in participation by their spouses. While the labor force participation rate of married men increased by about 0.2 percentage points, that of married women decreased by just over a full percentage point. These aggregate effects mask substantial heterogeneity in the population. Women facing the strongest disincentives were more than 2 percentage points less likely to work after the expansions. These findings imply that the EITC is effectively subsidizing married mothers to stay home, and therefore, have implications for the design of the program."," Eissa, NadaGeorgetown UU CA, DavisNadaNada EissaEissaEissa, Nada , Hoynes, Hilary WilliamsonHilaryHilary Williamson HoynesHoynesWilliamsonHoynes, Hilary Williamson",http://search.proquest.com/docview/56249680?accountid=14496," Taxation and Subsidies: Externalities, Redistributive Effects, Environmental Taxes and Subsidies (H23) , Personal Income and Other Nonbusiness Taxes and Subsidies, includes inheritance and gift taxes (H24) , Welfare, Well-Being, and Poverty: Government Programs, Provision and Effects of Welfare Programs (I38) , Marriage, Marital Dissolution, Family Structure, Domestic Abuse (J12) , Time Allocation and Labor Supply (J22) , U.S. , Northern America , Assistance , Families , Income Tax , Participation , Public Assistance , Tax System , Tax , Taxes , Transfers , Welfare",EconLit,2004
An Analysis of a Strategy for Management to Separate and Reward Supportive Shareholders,"Managers prefer investors who share similar expectations of their firms' prospects. Instead of taking the distribution of investor types as given, we investigate the question of how the managers may be able to effect a change in the pattern of ownership in a world where outside shareholders hold heterogeneous expectations. Under the requirements that the mechanism is costless to the firm and involves no initial cash transfer among the shareholders, the solution is a menu of securities in the form of sidebets among the shareholders. Ex post, the mechanism allows the high-valuation investors to own a greater proportion of the firm and be rewarded with a greater share of the firm's wealth gains."," Ang, James SFL State UBar Ilan UJamesJames S AngAngSAng, James S , Kraizberg, ElliElliElli KraizbergKraizbergKraizberg, Elli",http://search.proquest.com/docview/56232335?accountid=14496," Capital Budgeting, Fixed Investment and Inventory Studies, Capacity (G31) , Financing Policy, Financial Risk and Risk Management, Capital and Ownership Structure, Value of Firms, Goodwill (G32) , Firm , Ownership , Shareholder , Shares",EconLit,2004
The Impact of PROGRESA on Food Consumption,"In this article we used data from the Mexican poverty alleviation program called PROGRESA (Programa de Educacion, Salud y Alimentacion) to examine whether eligibility for a cash transfer provided by the program conditional on children's regular school attendance and regular visits to health centers is also associated with increased consumption of food. We used a longitudinal sample of approximately 24,000 households from 506 communities. A distinguishing characteristic of this sample was that some of the communities were randomly selected for participation in PROGRESA, while the rest were introduced into the program at later phases. Exploiting this feature in our analysis, we found that eligible households in the villages covered by PROGRESA increased caloric acquisition compared with eligible households not receiving these benefits. By November 1999, median beneficiary households in treatment localities obtained 6.4% more calories than did comparable households in control localities. Perhaps even more significant, we found that the impact was greatest on dietary quality as measured by the acquisition of calories from vegetable and animal products--a finding consistent with the view of respondents themselves that PROGRESA was enabling them to ""eat better."""," Hoddinott, JohnInternational Food Policy Research InstituteWorld BankJohnJohn HoddinottHoddinottHoddinott, John , Skoufias, EmmanuelEmmanuelEmmanuel SkoufiasSkoufiasSkoufias, Emmanuel",http://search.proquest.com/docview/56468262?accountid=14496," Health Production (I12) , Health: Government Policy, Regulation, Public Health (I18) , Welfare, Well-Being, and Poverty: Government Programs, Provision and Effects of Welfare Programs (I38) , Economic Development: Human Resources, Human Development, Income Distribution, Migration (O15) , Mexico , Latin America and the Caribbean , Health , Poverty Alleviation , Poverty , Transfers",EconLit,2004
Do Parental Cash Transfers Weaken Performance in College?,"When parents support children in college, does this undermine the incentive to do well? The authors test the hypothesis that parental cash transfers induce college students to commit moral hazard in their studies on a sample of nearly 1300 undergraduates at two Midwestern universities. After controlling for a wide variety of factors influencing college performance, it was found that those students receiving at least partial coverage from their parents for tuition and books: (1) failed their courses more often than self-financed students; (2) were at higher risk of being placed on academic probation; and (3) earned lower GPAs."," Bodvarsson, Orn BU NEWashburn UOrnOrn B BodvarssonBodvarssonBBodvarsson, Orn B , Walker, Rosemary LRosemaryRosemary L WalkerWalkerLWalker, Rosemary L",http://search.proquest.com/docview/56471925?accountid=14496," Household Production and Intrahousehold Allocation (D13) , Analysis of Education (I21) , U.S. , Northern America",EconLit,2004
Educational financing and lifetime earnings,"This paper formulates and estimates a dynamic programming model of optimal educational financing decisions. The main purpose of the paper is to measure the effect of short-term parental cash transfers, received during school, on educational borrowing and in-school work decisions, and on post-graduation lifetime earnings. The estimated parameters of the model imply that parental cash transfers do not significantly influence post-graduation lifetime earnings. Long-term factors such as family background and prior human capital investments are more important. Parental cash transfers do, however, significantly determine the decision to borrow or work during school and the level of lifetime consumption.

Assistance to Poor Households When Income Is Not Observed: Targeted In-Kind and In-Cash Transfers,"Policymakers frequently design self-targeting programs or target poor areas to assist poor families when income is not observed. Self-targeting schemes take advantage of differences in participation costs in assistance programs across households. Geographic targeting assumes that transfers are solely determined by the region of residence: to receive the benefits, households not initially present in the targeted areas must relocate away from their original place of residence and live with the poor, which entails a cost that can also be interpreted as a participation cost in the assistance program. The paper shows that a combination of in-kind and in-cash transfers tied to the consumption of a publicly provided private good targeted to the poor becomes very useful when non-poor households have different participation costs. By distinguishing users and non-users of public facilities additional in-cash transfers can be directed to the poor more effectively. The paper demonstrates that the publicly provided good ends up being undersupplied, and the distortion becomes less important as participation costs rise. More importantly, it shows that this kind of redistributive program dominates a pure in-cash scheme."," Pinto, Santiago MWV USantiagoSantiago M PintoPintoMPinto, Santiago M",http://search.proquest.com/docview/56448058?accountid=14496," Publicly Provided Private Goods (H42) , Welfare, Well-Being, and Poverty: Government Programs, Provision and Effects of Welfare Programs (I38) , Assistance , Transfers",EconLit,2004
Food-for-work versus cash-for-work: emergency assistance in Palestine,"In this paper we analyse the provision of emergency assistance (food assistance, cash transfers, employment programmes, etc) to a country whose economy has been decimated since the start of the second intifada. We try to simulate the different potential effects brought about by these different policies and, in particular, to draw some policy implications concerning the Food-for-Work versus Cash-for-Work debate. To that end we have constructed a general equilibrium model of the Palestinian economy that we calibrate on the (pre-intifada) Social Accounting Matrix (SAM) of 1998. We give a so-called `intifada-shock' to construct a counterfactual `post-intifada' SAM which serves as basis for our policy simulations. We show that monetary aid from abroad is to be preferred to food aid from abroad. We argue that a labour-oriented approach (subsidizing the most labour-intensive sectors) is to be preferred to a welfare-oriented approach where the subsidized sectors produce those goods that dominate the consumption basket.

On the reform of the forms of care insurance services - a family economic approach,"With the aging of the population, the demand for long-term care is likely to increase. In order to delay entry into nursing homes and thus to reduce costs, a so called matching transfer is tested by social experiments in Germany between 2004 and 2008. A matching transfer can be used for soft care services such as home delivery and laundry and reading services. These services are not paid by the current long-term care social insurance. In this paper we develop a non-cooperative model of a family consisting of a disabled mother and her grown daughter. The mother demands for formal care, soft care and informal care, the daughter provides informal care. We deduct various hypotheses on how the care arrangement depends on cash transfers, in-kind transfers and the experimentally tested matching transfer.

Securing Old Age: The Case for 'Social' Pensions in Developing Countries,"With growing populations of older people in developing countries, the disproportionate numbers who are ageing in poverty is an increasing concern. During the last decade it has become more widely accepted in development circles that economic growth alone will not reduce or eliminate poverty, especially of particularly disadvantaged groups such as older people. Interest has therefore increased in the role that social protection may play in supporting vulnerable groups, both for their immediate assistance and to help provide stronger foundations for overall growth. At the same time a number of developing countries have introduced a variety of basic cash transfer schemes targeted at older people. Although the majority are aimed at those in poverty, a few have chosen to introduce universal benefits. Evidence indicates that these schemes have the potential for a positive impact on old-age poverty. Questions of affordability and feasibility need to be considered, but there is a clear case to be made for developing further programmes and international donors need to be prepared to give effective support."," Gorman, MarkHelpAge InternationalMarkMark GormanGormanGorman, Mark",http://search.proquest.com/docview/56406110?accountid=14496," Social Security and Public Pensions (H55) , Economics of the Elderly, Economics of the Handicapped, Non-labor Market Discrimination (J14) , Economic Development: Human Resources, Human Development, Income Distribution, Migration (O15) , Ageing , Developing Countries , Development , Old Age , Pension , Population , Poverty",EconLit,2005
The Cost of Conditional Cash Transfers,"A common criticism of antipoverty programmes is that a large proportion of their budgets never reaches the intended beneficiaries but is absorbed by administration costs. Yet, there is little empirical evidence on the costs, and even less on the cost structures, of such programmes. This paper outlines and implements a replicable methodology for a disaggregated cost analysis of a pilot conditional cash transfer programme in Nicaragua, examining the administration and private costs associated with a one-unit transfer to a beneficiary--referred to as the cost-transfer ratio. We find that for a meaningful assessment of cost efficiency, it is misleading to make calculations using only the typically available raw accounting data. Rather, one must delve into the details and specific activities of the programme. This is particularly important for pilot programmes, which typically have many upfront fixed costs associated with design and setting up operations. It is also important for conditional cash transfer programmes, which have additional costs associated with their specific design features and require changes in beneficiary behaviour that may engender substantial private costs."," Caldes, NataliaU Politecnica de MadridInternational Food Policy Research Institute, Washington, DCNataliaNatalia CaldesCaldesCaldes, Natalia , Maluccio, John AJohnJohn A MaluccioMaluccioAMaluccio, John A",http://search.proquest.com/docview/56429753?accountid=14496," Positive Analysis of Policy Formulation and Implementation (D78) , National Government Expenditures and Welfare Programs (H53) , Welfare, Well-Being, and Poverty: Government Programs, Provision and Effects of Welfare Programs (I38) , Economic Development: Human Resources, Human Development, Income Distribution, Migration (O15) , Nicaragua , Latin America and the Caribbean , Administration , Anti Poverty , Antipoverty , Transfers",EconLit,2005
Evaluating the Impact of Conditional Cash Transfer Programs,"Several developing economies have recently introduced conditional cash transfer programs, which provide money to poor families contingent on certain behavior, usually investments in human capital, such as sending children to school or bringing them to health centers. The approach is both an alternative to more traditional social assistance programs and a demand-side complement to the supply of health and education services. Unlike most development initiatives, conditional cash transfer programs have been subject to rigorous evaluations of their effectiveness using experimental or quasi-experimental methods. Evaluation results for programs launched in Colombia, Honduras, Jamaica, Mexico, Nicaragua, and Turkey reveal successes in addressing many of the failures in delivering social assistance, such as weak poverty targeting, disincentive effects, and limited welfare impacts. There is clear evidence of success from the first generation of programs in Colombia, Mexico, and Nicaragua in increasing enrollment rates, improving preventive health care, and raising household consumption. Many questions remain unanswered, however, including the potential of conditional cash transfer programs to function well under different conditions, to address a broader range of challenges among poor and vulnerable populations, and to prevent the intergenerational transmission of poverty."," Rawlings, Laura BWorld BankSEDESOLLauraLaura B RawlingsRawlingsBRawlings, Laura B , Rubio, Gloria MGloriaGloria M RubioRubioMRubio, Gloria M",http://search.proquest.com/docview/56392935?accountid=14496," Welfare, Well-Being, and Poverty: Government Programs, Provision and Effects of Welfare Programs (I38) , Economic Development: Human Resources, Human Development, Income Distribution, Migration (O15) , LDCs , Assistance , Development , Education , Health , Human Capital , Poor , Social Assistance , Transfers",EconLit,2005
Reassessing Conditional Cash Transfer Programs,"During the past decade, the use of conditional cash transfer programs to increase investment in human capital has generated considerable excitement in both research and policy forums. This article surveys the existing literature, which suggests that most conditional cash transfer programs are used for essentially one of two purposes: restoring efficiency when externalities exist or improving equity by targeting resources to poor households. The programs often meet their stated objectives, but in some instances there is tension between the efficiency and equity objectives. The overall impact of a program depends on the gains and losses associated with each objective."," Das, JishnuWorld BankWorld BankWorld BankJishnuJishnu DasDasDas, Jishnu , Do, Quy-ToanQuy-ToanQuy-Toan DoDoDo, Quy-Toan , Ozler, BerkBerkBerk OzlerOzlerOzler, Berk",http://search.proquest.com/docview/56392891?accountid=14496," Welfare, Well-Being, and Poverty: Government Programs, Provision and Effects of Welfare Programs (I38) , Human Capital, Skills, Occupational Choice, Labor Productivity (J24) , Economic Development: Human Resources, Human Development, Income Distribution, Migration (O15) , LDCs , Human Capital , Policy , Poor , Transfers",EconLit,2005

Conditional Cash Transfer Programmes: Experiences from Latin America,"This article analyzes the experience of five conditional cash transfer programmes established in Latin America to reduce poverty and increase human capital in the form of education, health and nutrition. These innovative programmes should help toward the Millennium Development Goals, and some have become pillars of their countries' anti-poverty efforts. The article begins by presenting some of the concepts that underline conditional transfer programmes. It then goes on to examine the following experiences: the Bolsa Escola programme and the Programme for the Eradication of Child Labour (Brazil), Families in Action (Colombia), the Social Protection Network (Nicaragua) and the Oportunidades programme (Mexico), analyzing their goals, components, targeting mechanisms, impact and efficiency. The article concludes by offering some policy recommendations and identifying design components that might serve as good practice when programmes of this kind are implemented."," Villatoro, PabloECLACPabloPablo VillatoroVillatoroVillatoro, Pablo",http://search.proquest.com/docview/56510643?accountid=14496," Health: Government Policy, Regulation, Public Health (I18) , Analysis of Education (I21) , Welfare, Well-Being, and Poverty: Government Programs, Provision and Effects of Welfare Programs (I38) , Human Capital, Skills, Occupational Choice, Labor Productivity (J24) , Economic Development: Human Resources, Human Development, Income Distribution, Migration (O15) , Latin America , Latin America and the Caribbean , Anti Poverty , Development , Education , Health , Human Capital , Nutrition , Poverty , Transfers",EconLit,2005
Do Conditional Cash Transfers Influence Migration? A Study Using Experimental Data from the Mexican PROGRESA Program,"Prior research on Mexican migration has shown that social networks & economic incentives play an important role in determining migration outcomes. We use experimental data from PROGRESA, Mexico's primary poverty-reduction program, to evaluate the effects of conditional cash transfers on migration both domestically & to the United States. Our study complements a growing body of literature aimed at overcoming longstanding hurdles to the establishment of causal validity in empirical studies of migration. Analysis based on the data collected before & after the program s onset shows that conditional transfers reduce US. migration but not domestic migration. The data also enable us to explore the role of existing family & community migration networks. The results show that migration networks strongly influence migration, but that the effect of conditional transfers on migration is apparently not mediated by existing migration network structures. Our results suggest that conditional transfers may be helpful in managing rural out-migration, particularly to the United States. Tables, Figures, References.

Winners and Losers in the Italian Welfare State: A Microsimulation Analysis of Income Redistribution Considering In-Kind Transfers,"In this paper we consider income distribution in Italy, and evaluate the redistributive impact of in-kind transfers by using SHIW data provided by the Bank of Italy. The analysis is conducted at the household level, comparing families with different needs by means of equivalence scales. We consider both cash and noncash income transfers, looking in particular at health services and educational services. Our results show that--in a given year--redistribution in Italy (as in other industrialised countries) is operated mainly through cash transfers, while the redistributive power of in-kind transfers appears to be limited, and their impact on income distribution less than that obtained with direct taxation. Recent pensions reforms will probably reduce cash transfers, and call for new ways of redistributing income."," Sonedda, DanielaSEMEQ, U Piemonte OrientaleU TurinDanielaDaniela SoneddaSoneddaSonedda, Daniela , Turati, GilbertoGilbertoGilberto TuratiTuratiTurati, Gilberto",http://search.proquest.com/docview/56478948?accountid=14496," Personal Income, Wealth, and Their Distributions (D31) , Taxation and Subsidies: Externalities, Redistributive Effects, Environmental Taxes and Subsidies (H23) , Capitalist Systems: Political Economy (P16) , Italy , Europe , Distribution , Income Distribution , Income Transfer , Income , Redistribution",EconLit,2005
Avaliacao do impacto dos programas Bolsa-Escola sobre o trabalho infantil no Brasil. (With English summary.),"The minimum income for school attendance programs--like Bolsa-Escola in Brazil--in general do not request formally that the child quit his/her job to receive the benefit. However, since school attendance is mandatory, which reduces the available time for other activities, and there is a cash transfer that substitutes for the child's income from work, the decrease in the labor market participation is a spillover effect of the program, whose objectives are to stimulate the demand for formal education and to alleviate current poverty. Evaluating the impact of the Bolsa-Escola Programs on child labour in Brazil based on microdata from the Brazilian National Household Sample Survey 2001 [Pesquisa Nacional por Amostra de Domicilios (PNAD)], using least squares model for the number of weekly hours worked by children for those who work and a probit model for the family's decision for children's participation in the labor force, it is possible to conclude that the program is really efficient to decrease children's weekly hours of work, but the results for participation in the labor force were inconclusive. An additional stipend has diminished the weekly hours worked by children living in rural and urban areas by approximately three hours."," Ferro, Andrea RodriguesU Sao PauloU Sao PauloAndreaAndrea Rodrigues FerroFerroRodriguesFerro, Andrea Rodrigues , Kassouf, Ana LuciaAnaAna Lucia KassoufKassoufLuciaKassouf, Ana Lucia",http://search.proquest.com/docview/56557961?accountid=14496," Analysis of Education (I21) , Fertility, Family Planning, Child Care, Children, Youth (J13) , Labor Standards: Labor Force Composition (J82) , Economic Development: Human Resources, Human Development, Income Distribution, Migration (O15) , Brazil , Latin America and the Caribbean , Child , Labor Markets",EconLit,2005
The Mexican Oportunidades Program: Questioning the Linking of Security to Conditional Social Investments for Mothers and Children,"The article examines the ways in which the Mexican Oportunidades program, a neo-liberal social investment program, is applied in Mexico. It comments on both the efficacy of the program & the ways in which motherhood & citizenship are redefined. The Oportunidades program is a conditional cash transfer program that provides money for nutrition & educational scholarships to poor mothers on condition that the funds are used toward enhancing their children's human capital development. These conditions are intended to lead to the eventual integration of the children into the market economy as skilled individuals. The article points out how the Mexican conditional cash transfer program has shifted the responsibility for social security from the state to the non-state sector, namely to mothers & families, banks & markets. The investment in children is done through mothers' regulated participation, based on conditions, & designed along gendered, cultural norms of mothering. I argue that the conditional cash transfer system attempts to insert mothers into the market as creditworthy consumers, yet it has inserted them into the economy & into political discourse not as citizens with rights, but as mothers with increased social responsibilities. Furthermore, even if mothers abide by all the conditions & children have access to additional years of schooling, the efficacy of this social investment model is called into question due to the instability of the Mexican economy, the precariousness of work, & high levels of poverty & inequality in Mexico.

We compare the results of (1) ex ante simulations obtained through a reduced-form model of the effects of cash transfers on children's school enrollment and labor participation with (2) ex post impact estimates. The ex ante estimation of the effects of parental income rests on an instrumental-variable strategy that uses housing characteristics and household durables as indicators of parents' permanent income.

Equality of Opportunity and Optimal Cash and In-Kind Policies,"This paper examines the argument for public provision of certain private goods, like education and health, based on equality of opportunity by studying the utility possibility frontier of a society in which there is a concern for the distribution of these goods. A given quality of education or health services can be consumed for free in the public sector, but people can opt-out and purchase their desired quality levels in the private sector. Some of the conclusions are: (i) a pure cash transfer is optimal when the utility redistribution is either ""sufficiently"" small or large; (ii) if and only if both the equality-of-opportunity concern and the utility redistribution are large enough, can an in-kind program which attracts the whole population be justified; (iii) even when everybody chooses the in-kind program, it may be optimal to perform some additional utility redistribution by increasing the size of such program."," Gasparini, Leonardo CCEDLAS, U Nacional de La PlataWV ULeonardoLeonardo C GaspariniGaspariniCGasparini, Leonardo C , Pinto, Santiago MSantiagoSantiago M PintoPintoMPinto, Santiago M",http://search.proquest.com/docview/56552456?accountid=14496," Taxation and Subsidies: Externalities, Redistributive Effects, Environmental Taxes and Subsidies (H23) , Publicly Provided Private Goods (H42) , Analysis of Education (I21) , Education",EconLit,2006
"Per il Mezzogiorno, ma non solo nel Mezzogiorno. (For Mezzogiorno, but Not Only in Mezzogiorno. With English summary.)","Marked and widening differences in unemployment and non-employment rates across Italian regions can be reduced by allowing two re-equilibrating factors to operate. The first is wage adjustment. If unemployment is higher in one region than another, wages in the high-unemployment region decline vis-a-vis wages in the low-unemployment region. This attracts investment, which leads to more jobs in areas of high unemployment. The second re-equilibrating factor is regional labour mobility. As the promotion of local development is relatively slow, the reduction of differentials in unemployment rates typically involves also some outward migration, which may well be just temporary. As soon as unemployment differentials disappear, migrants tend to go back to the original area of residence. In Italy, these two re-equilibrating factors are only partly allowed to operate at the regional level. Still rather centralised wage setting institutions prevent the emergence of significant regional wage differentials. At the same time, a number of factors--including state transfers to the high-unemployment areas--reduce the pressure to migrate. Persistently high unemployment in the South is also associated with low participation rates and a deterioration of the environment in which firms have to operate. The rule of law is poorly enforced due also to the development of a sizeable informal sector. Moreover, the state administration--whose ranks are often artificially inflated as state sector jobs are typically a hidden transfer to high unemployment regions--is highly inefficient. Frequently the public sector pays more than the private sector (at least in terms of entry wages) and provides job security, while tolerating shirking, moonlighting and low productivity. If it is difficult to get a public sector job when already employed in the private sector, this encourages ""wait-unemployment"" while people (sometimes the most educated people) queue for public sector jobs to become vacant. Thus individuals' wage aspirations are relatively high in spite of high unemployment. Hence improvements in labour demand conditions, e.g., through a widening of interregional wage differentials, may by themselves not be sufficient to absorb long-term unemployment and to increase participation significantly in these regions. In order to move the Mezzogiorno away from the high-unemployment low-participation equilibria in which it is trapped, it seems necessary to act on both the demand and the supply side. On the demand side, it is necessary to pursue greater decentralisation in collective bargaining, as wages should be allowed to vary across regions so as to reflect more closely the differences in labour productivity. Decentralisation in pay determination should extend to the public administration, and be accompanied by the introduction of incentives for higher productivity and hiring procedures which discourage queuing. On the supply side, the task is to transform along welfare-to-work principles the cash transfers provided to non-employed individuals in these regions. A key requirement for this is to have unemployment benefits, rather than other instruments (e.g., early retirement and invalidity pensions) which merely encourage non-participation in the labour market rather than supporting job search."," Boeri, TitoIGIER, U Bocconi, MilanTitoTito BoeriBoeriBoeri, Tito",http://search.proquest.com/docview/56679078?accountid=14496," Welfare, Well-Being, and Poverty: Government Programs, Provision and Effects of Welfare Programs (I38) , Wage Level and Structure, Wage Differentials (J31) , Geographic Labor Mobility, Immigrant Workers (J61) , Unemployment: Models, Duration, Incidence, and Job Search (J64) , Urban, Rural, Regional, Real Estate, and Transportation Economics: Regional Migration, Regional Labor Markets, Population, Neighborhood Characteristics (R23) , Italy , Europe , Employment , Labor Mobility , Mobility , Regional , Unemployment , Wage",EconLit,2006
"Marital Disruption, Step Children, and Transfers to the Elderly","Divorce has become an important part of life for many in Europe and North America. For the United States, it has been estimated that approximately one half of all marriages will end in divorce. As a consequence of the high incidence of divorce and nonmarital childbirth, and subsequent (re)marriage, the traditional nuclear family is rapidly being augmented by new, more complex family structures. A substantial literature within the social sciences has focused on the effects of nontraditional family structures on children. A smaller literature has focused on the positive effects of marriage and negative effects of divorce on adult men and adult women. Relatively little is known about the effects of nontraditional family structures on adult children's transfers to their disabled elderly parents. In this study we investigate the effects of divorce, remarriage and step children on intergenerational living arrangements and adult children's time and cash transfers to their disabled, unpartnered elderly parents. Data for this analysis are drawn from matched observations from waves one and two of the Assets and Health Dynamics of the Elderly (AHEAD) survey, a nationally-representative sample of community-based persons aged 70 and older in 1993 from the United States. We limited our sample to wave 2 respondents who reported in wave two their marital status as widowed or as divorced/separated, who had at least one child, and who reported having difficulty with at least one basic or instrumental activity of daily living.

Enlisting China to Stop a Nuclear North Korea,"North Korea's recent nuclear test further reduces the likelihood of dissuading Pyongyang from developing a nuclear arsenal. The North's willingness to negotiate seriously is unclear, but the country with the greatest influence on Pyongyang is China. However, Beijing more fears a collapse of the North & creation of a unified Korea allied with America than it fears a North Korean nuclear weapon. Thus, the United States must emphasize that China would be unable to avoid the costs of North Korean nuclear proliferation. Continuing nuclear activities in the North would encourage the United States to push for tighter sanctions & consider military action. Moreover, Washington should indicate that it would not seek to dissuade South Korea & Japan from building countervailing weapons should Pyongyang move ahead. Under these circumstances, China would have an incentive to increase pressure on North Korea to cooperate. In particular, Beijing should work with surrounding states to cut off the luxuries (& the cash transfers used to pay for them) which are used by Kim Jong Il to cement the loyalty of party officials & military officers. Moreover, China should open its border to North Korean refugees, which would help destabilize the Kim regime. In return, the United States, South Korea, Japan, & other states should aid China by accepting refugees & contributing money to alleviate Beijing's burden in caring for North Koreans crossing the border. Moreover, Washington should promise not to take geopolitical advantage of Chinese cooperation; in the event of unification, the United States would withdraw its troops & end its military alliance with the Republic of Korea, thereby eliminating an American presence on China's border.

Making Conditional Cash Transfer Programs More Efficient: Designing for Maximum Effect of the Conditionality,"Conditional cash transfer programs are now used extensively to encourage poor parents to increase investments in their children's human capital. These programs can be large and expensive, motivating a quest for greater efficiency through increased impact of the programs' imposed conditions on human capital formation. This requires designing the programs' targeting and calibration rules specifically to achieve this result. Using data from the Progresa randomized experiment in Mexico, this article shows that large efficiency gains can be achieved by taking into account how much the probability of a child's enrollment is affected by a conditional transfer. Rules for targeting and calibration can be made easy to implement by selecting indicators that are simple, observable, and verifiable and that cannot be manipulated by beneficiaries. The Mexico case shows that these efficiency gains can be achieved without increasing inequality among poor households."," de Janvry, AlainU CA, BerkeleyU CA, BerkeleyAlainAlain de Janvryde Janvryde Janvry, Alain , Sadoulet, ElisabethElisabethElisabeth SadouletSadouletSadoulet, Elisabeth",http://search.proquest.com/docview/56503358?accountid=14496," Welfare, Well-Being, and Poverty: Government Programs, Provision and Effects of Welfare Programs (I38) , Fertility, Family Planning, Child Care, Children, Youth (J13) , Human Capital, Skills, Occupational Choice, Labor Productivity (J24) , Economic Development: Human Resources, Human Development, Income Distribution, Migration (O15) , Mexico , Children , Human Capital , Poor , Transfers",EconLit,2006

Can Conditional Cash Transfer Programs Serve as Safety Nets in Keeping Children at School and from Working When Exposed to Shocks?,"Income shocks on poor households are known to induce parents to take their children out of school and send them to work when other risk-coping instruments are insufficient. State dependence in school attendance further implies that these responses to short-run shocks have long-term consequences on children's human capital development. Conditional cash transfer (CCT) programs, where the condition is on school attendance, have been shown to be effective in increasing educational achievements and reducing child work. We ask the question here of whether or not children who benefit from conditional transfers are protected from the impacts of shocks on school enrollment and work. We develop a model of a household's decision regarding child school and work under conditions of a school re-entry cost, conditional transfers, and exposure to shocks. We take model predictions to the data using a panel from Mexico's Progresa experience with randomized treatment. Results show that there is strong state dependence in school enrollment. We find that the conditional transfers helped protect enrollment, but did not refrain parents from increasing child work in response to shocks. These results reveal that CCT programs can provide an additional benefit to recipients in acting as safety nets for the schooling of the poor."," de Janvry, AlainU CA, BerkeleyU CA, BerkeleyU CA, BerkeleyWorld BankAlainAlain de Janvryde Janvryde Janvry, Alain , Finan, FredericoFredericoFrederico FinanFinanFinan, Frederico , Sadoulet, ElisabethElisabethElisabeth SadouletSadouletSadoulet, Elisabeth , Vakis, RenosRenosRenos VakisVakisVakis, Renos",http://search.proquest.com/docview/56512446?accountid=14496," Analysis of Education (I21) , Welfare, Well-Being, and Poverty: Government Programs, Provision and Effects of Welfare Programs (I38) , Fertility, Family Planning, Child Care, Children, Youth (J13) , Labor Standards: Labor Force Composition (J82) , Economic Development: Human Resources, Human Development, Income Distribution, Migration (O15) , Child , Children , Development , Human Capital , Poor , Safety Net , Transfers",EconLit,2006
Program Conditionality and Food Security: The Impact of PROGRESA and PROCAMPO Transfers in Rural Mexico,"This paper examines the PROGRESA and PROCAMPO cash transfer programs in Mexico and evaluates their impact on household food security and nutrition. These two programs differ in their targeting and design: PROGRESA is aimed at women and program conditionality is linked to current consumption and human capital investment; PROCAMPO benefits male farmers and program conditionality is linked to agricultural production. The main question addressed by the paper is whether a cash transfer program geared to agricultural production can have the same impact on food security as a cash transfer program geared to consumption through purchases. Our results suggest that monetary payments linked to a productive asset--land--can have as large or larger impact on food security as cash transfers not linked to a productive asset. We show that both programs boost total food consumption and caloric intake in similar proportions. However, increased food security is achieved through different channels--for PROGRESA through purchases while for PROCAMPO through investment in home production. This suggests that the choice of program design depends on objectives beyond total food consumption and caloric intake, such as consumption from specific food categories, diversity of food consumption, investment in agricultural production, and the degree of access to retail food markets."," Ruiz-Arranz, MIMFUN Food and Agriculture OrganizationU NCSant'Anna School of Advanced StudiesAmerican UMM Ruiz-ArranzRuiz-ArranzRuiz-Arranz, M , Davis, BBB DavisDavisDavis, B , Handa, SSS HandaHandaHanda, S , Stampini, MMM StampiniStampiniStampini, M , Winters, PPP WintersWintersWinters, P",http://search.proquest.com/docview/56628641?accountid=14496," Taxation and Subsidies: Externalities, Redistributive Effects, Environmental Taxes and Subsidies (H23) , Health Production (I12) , Human Capital, Skills, Occupational Choice, Labor Productivity (J24) , Microeconomic Analyses of Economic Development (O12) , Economic Development: Human Resources, Human Development, Income Distribution, Migration (O15) , Mexico , Latin America and the Caribbean , Farmers , Food Security , Human Capital , Nutrition",EconLit,2006
Mitigating myths about policy effectiveness: evaluation of Mexico's antipoverty and human resource investment program,"What is known about the effectiveness of many policies is dominated by prior beliefs or myths rather than by careful analyses. This article discusses an important exception to this generalization in which, in sharp contrast to most previous and much concurrent and subsequent practice, serious efforts at evaluation were implemented from the start: the Mexican PROGRESA/Oportunidades antipoverty and human resource investment program, initiated in 1997. The article begins by introducing the program and providing relevant background material and then summarizes initial evaluation results in rural areas, where both of the authors were extensively involved in the evaluation, and then turns more briefly to the current evaluation of Oportunidades in urban areas and the longer-run evaluation of PROGRESA/Oportunidades in rural areas. This program has been an important model not only in terms of using conditional cash transfers to induce human resource investments but also in being serious about policy evaluation.

"Immigrants' Social Rights in Comparative Perspective: Welfare Regimes, Forms of Immigration and Immigration Policy Regimes","In analysing the social rights of immigrants, this paper draws on insights from comparative welfare state research & international migration studies. On the premise that the type of welfare regime has an impact on immigrants' social rights, it utilizes Esping-Andersen's welfare regime typology as a point of departure. However, this typology must be complemented by two analytical constructs borrowed from the international migration literature: the immigration policy regime & entry categories associated with the form of immigration. The paper examines the social rights of immigrants in three countries generally regarded as exemplars of the welfare regime types: the United States, representing the liberal regime; Germany, the conservative corporatist regime; & Sweden, the social democratic regime. It maps out immigrants' formal incorporation into the welfare systems of the three countries & pays special attention to legislation from 1990 onwards in order to understand the interplay between welfare regimes, the forms of immigration, & the immigration policy regimes in shaping immigrants' social rights.

Poverty Reduction: The Missing Piece of Pension Reform in Latin America,"Employment-based pension plans constitute the main form of pension provision in Latin America. Although recent pension reform in the region has focused on strengthening these, old-age poverty remains high in most countries in the region, with older people over-represented among the poor. The article argues that ensuring old-age support for poor and vulnerable groups involves a different set of priorities and options for pension reform, namely a strong focus on tax-financed public cash transfer programmes. Cash transfer programmes focused on poor older people are the missing piece of pension reform in the region.

"Mothers at the Service of the New Poverty Agenda: Progresa Oportunidades, Mexico's Conditional Transfer Programme","This article considers some of the changes and continuities in social protection in Latin America through a focus on the ways in which motherhood is positioned as key to the success of the new anti-poverty programmes that have followed structural reform. It examines a flagship cash transfer programme known as Progresa /Oportunidades (Opportunities) established in Mexico in 1997 and now being widely adopted in the region. Characterized by some commentators as a quintessentially neo-liberal programme, it is argued that Oportunidades represents a novel combination of earlier maternalist social policy approaches with the conditional, co-responsibility models associated with the recent approaches to social welfare and poverty relief endorsed by international policy actors. In the first section, the gendered assumptions that have governed Latin American social policy are described; the second outlines social policy provision in Latin America and identifies the key elements of the new approaches to poverty; and the third critically examines the broader implications of the Mexican programme's selective and gendered construction of social need premised, as it is, on re-traditionalizing gendered roles and responsibilities.

"Simple Transfers, Complex Outcomes: The Impacts of Pensions on Poor Households in Brazil","Drawing on quantitative survey data and in-depth interviews, this article seeks to map out the potential direct and indirect effects of simple cash transfers on households in impoverished rural and urban settings. Brazil is shown to have an extensive system of old age pensions, which affords almost universal coverage to households containing older people. These benefits have a significant impact on levels of poverty and vulnerability in recipient households. They also facilitate access to essential healthcare items, such as drugs, which are seldom freely available through the state health system. The in-depth interviews reveal that pensions can have important effects on intra-household relations, but these effects were not generalizable nor easily captured by quantitative survey tools. There was clear evidence that pensions reduced the propensity of older people to remain economically active, but this must be understood in a context of limited employment opportunities for all age groups and a high prevalence of disability. Overall, the article demonstrates the complex effects of a relatively simple cash transfer, which policy makers need to take into account. Tables, Figures, References.

The Experience of Conditional Cash Transfers in Latin America and the Caribbean,"This article discusses the experience of six conditional cash transfer programmes in Latin America, a model of social safety-nets which has grown to dominate the social protection sector in the region during the past decade. While they have been generally successful in terms of achieving their core objective, it is still not clear whether these programmes constitute the most cost-efficient or sustainable solution to the development bottleneck they seek to address. Furthermore, the almost exclusive focus on the human capital accumulation of children leads to missed opportunties in terms of impact on household welfare and the broader rural development context.

Reducing Child Poverty with Cash Transfers: A Sure Thing?,"Children are disproportionately represented among the income-poor, many suffer from severe deprivation, and their poverty and vulnerability have cumulative and long-term consequences. This article provides a comparative examination of the poverty-reduction effectiveness of cash transfer programmes targeting children, focusing on three types of such programmes: the Child Support Grant in South Africa, family allowances in transition countries, and targeted conditional cash transfer programmes in Latin America and the Caribbean. It finds that, despite differences in design, cash transfer programmes targeting children in poor households are an effective way of reducing poverty. References.

Cash Transfers for School-Age Children in African Countries: Simulation of Impacts on Poverty and School Attendance,"Drawing on data from 15 African countries, simulation models suggest that to reduce the poverty headcount ratio by increasing incomes among poor households, cash transfers would have to be sizeable - in the range of 2-8% of GDP. Even then, an increase in income, by itself, would not suffice to increase school attendance significantly. Higher impacts at lower cost could be achieved by making transfers targeted and conditional. However, the administrative costs of detailed targeting (e.g. by income) are known to be high. On the other hand, some broad measures, such as targeting rural children only, produce results almost as good as income-linked targeting and, given their low administrative costs, are to be preferred.

Social Cash Transfers in Low-Income African Countries: Conditional or Unconditional?,"Conventional wisdom hails Latin American experience with conditional cash transfers (CCTs) as successful, but, to the authors' knowledge, there have been no rigorous analyses of the respective costs and benefits of conditional versus unconditional transfers. The impact of conditionality itself is therefore not known. This article argues that the important contextual differences between Africa and Latin America, in quality and quantity of service provision, capacity to implement conditionality, socio-cultural, ethnic and political contexts, and, potentially, the benefit:cost ratio of conditionality, may well make the introduction of CCTs in Africa inappropriate. It sets out a number of questions and points to a new case in Chipata, Zambia, which will be rigorously monitored from the outset."," Schubert, BerndBerlinOverseas Development InstituteBerndBernd SchubertSchubertSchubert, Bernd , Slater, RachelRachelRachel SlaterSlaterSlater, Rachel",http://search.proquest.com/docview/56722312?accountid=14496," Welfare, Well-Being, and Poverty: Government Programs, Provision and Effects of Welfare Programs (I38) , Economic Development: Human Resources, Human Development, Income Distribution, Migration (O15) , Africa , Latin America , Africa , Latin America and the Caribbean , Transfers",EconLit,2006
Moving from Emergency Food Aid to Predictable Cash Transfers: Recent Experience in Ethiopia,"Changes in the way hunger is tackled in Ethiopia have significant implications for its estimated 8.8 million chronically and acutely food-insecure people. This article compares findings from the new Productive Safety-Net Programme (PSNP) in two districts where Save the Children-UK is a PSNP implementing partner or has its own cash-based livelihood-development programme. Evidence from the first year suggests that shifting from food to cash transfer programmes has implications for targeting and for the availability and price of food in local markets, especially in remote, deficit areas, and therefore requires a range of complementary measures, if the programmes are to be successful.

Cash or Food Aid? A General Equilibrium Analysis for Ethiopia,"This article examines the relative effectiveness of cash and in-kind food aid, using an economy-wide modelling framework and a social accounting matrix constructed for Ethiopia. It argues that cash aid has larger positive effects on household welfare, with multiplier effects on households other than direct recipients, and that food aid provides a disincentive to local food production. However, where cash transfers cause food prices to rise, welfare losses may be suffered by those who are neither targeted nor beneficiaries. The highly aggregated nature of the model allows only a tentative policy recommendation in favour of cash transfers."," Gelan, AyeleMacaulay Institute, AberdeenAyeleAyele GelanGelanGelan, Ayele",http://search.proquest.com/docview/56722502?accountid=14496," Foreign Aid (F35) , Welfare, Well-Being, and Poverty: Government Programs, Provision and Effects of Welfare Programs (I38) , Economic Development: Agriculture, Natural Resources, Energy, Environment, Other Primary Products (O13) , Economic Development: Human Resources, Human Development, Income Distribution, Migration (O15) , International Linkages to Development, Role of International Organizations (O19) , Agricultural Policy, Food Policy (Q18) , Ethiopia , Africa , Aid , Food Aid , Food Production , Food , Transfers , Welfare",EconLit,2006

"Does money work? Cash transfers to ex-combatants in disarmament, demobilisation and reintegration processes","This paper analyses the relevance and potential of cash transfers as part of the disarmament, demobilisation and reintegration (DDR) assistance packages provided to ex-combatants in transitions from war to peace. To this end, a theoretical framework is established that permits the identification of the advantages and disadvantages of using cash in DDR. Subsequently, an empirical analysis is carried out to compare selected theoretical assumptions on the use of cash with the reality of lessons learned from recent experience in Sierra Leone and other African countries. The study shows that some theoretical drawbacks commonly associated with the use of cash in DDR processes may indeed bear out in practice. At the same time, though, the paper argues that the utility of cash transfers in DDR is affected by a variety of factors that go far beyond the simple choice of employing cash, most notably decisions on payment location, eligibility criteria and targeting.

"Conditional Transfers, Labor Supply, and Poverty: Microsimulating Oportunidades","This article summarizes a microsimulation exercise for the Mexican human development program Oportunidades and presents a series of simulations of its actual and potential impact upon poverty at the national, urban and rural levels. The microsimulation tool used for this paper makes accounting and behavioral exercises and aims to answer three main questions: What would have happened to poverty if the program had been cancelled, if benefits were doubled, or if urban beneficiaries were doubled? We conclude that Oportunidades can be associated with up to a third of the reduction in rural poverty in Mexico by the year 2002. Doubling benefits and targeting urban beneficiaries would reduce poverty a further 30 percent from its 2002 level. We also find that each percentage point of poverty reduction at the rural level costs around 326 million pesos per month in cash transfers (that is, 1.2 percent of the central government's total spending in 2002). Further reductions of poverty would have higher or lower average costs depending on the area and on whether they are performed either by extensions in coverage or by enlargement of benefits. Finally, behavioral simulations suggest that labor supply does not seem to be much affected by current cash transfers from Oportunidades."," Freije, SamuelU AmericasU CA, BerkeleySecretaria de Desarrollo SocialSamuelSamuel FreijeFreijeFreije, Samuel , Bando, RosangelaRosangelaRosangela BandoBandoBando, Rosangela , Arce, FernandaFernandaFernanda ArceArceArce, Fernanda",http://search.proquest.com/docview/56645442?accountid=14496," Measurement and Analysis of Poverty (I32) , Time Allocation and Labor Supply (J22) , Economic Development: Human Resources, Human Development, Income Distribution, Migration (O15) , Economic Development: Urban, Rural, Regional, and Transportation Analysis, Housing, Infrastructure (O18) , Urban, Rural, Regional, Real Estate, and Transportation Economics: Regional Migration, Regional Labor Markets, Population, Neighborhood Characteristics (R23) , Mexico , Latin America and the Caribbean , Development , Human Development , Labor Supply , Poverty , Rural , Urban",EconLit,2006
A re-examination of welfare states and inequality in rich nations: how in-kind transfers and indirect taxes change the story,"Previous studies find large cross-national differences in inequality amongst rich Western nations, due in large part to differences in the generosity of welfare state transfers. The United States is the least generous nation and the one having the most after-tax and transfer inequality. But these analyses are limited to the effects of cash and near-cash transfers and direct taxes on incomes, while on average, half of welfare state transfers in rich nations are in-kind benefits--health insurance, education, and other services. Counting in-kind benefits at government cost and accounting for the indirect taxes used to finance transfers substantially reduces cross-national differences in inequality at the bottom of the income distribution. The findings have implications for how we think about tradeoffs across welfare state domains that all nations face and we illustrate this with reference to the current U.S. debate about health insurance.[Copyright 2006 John Wiley and Sons, Ltd.]"," Garfinkel, IrwinIrwinIrwin GarfinkelGarfinkelGarfinkel, Irwin , Rainwater, LeeLeeLee RainwaterRainwaterRainwater, Lee , Smeeding, Timothy MTimothyTimothy M SmeedingSmeedingMSmeeding, Timothy M",http://search.proquest.com/docview/58743082?accountid=14496," Public welfare -- United States , Taxation -- United States , Health insurance -- United States",PAIS International,2006
From fome zero to bolsa famlia: social policies and poverty alleviation under Lula,"Under the administrations of Fernando Henrique Cardoso (1995-2002) and especially President Lula (2003-), conditional cash transfer (CCT) programmes have become adopted as mainstream social policy in Brazil. This follows a marked trend since the 1990s in Latin America towards the setting up of targeted safety nets to alleviate poverty. Lula consolidated and expanded CCTs, firstly under Fome Zero and later Bolsa Famlia, now the largest such scheme in the world. Its four sub-programmes (educational stipends to boost school attendance, maternal nutrition, food supplements and a domestic gas subsidy) benefit some 30 million of Brazil's poorest people, with a target of 44 million by 2006. Since 2003, spending on Bolsa Famlia has risen significantly to consume over one-third of the social assistance budget for the poorest sectors and it remained a flagship policy in the run-up to the presidential elections of October 2006. Although coverage of Bolsa Famlia is impressive, however, systematic evaluation of its social and economic impacts is still lacking. Evidence from other CCT programmes in Latin America suggests that positive results may be achieved in terms of meeting some immediate needs of the poor. However, there have been many implementation problems. These include poor beneficiary targeting, lack of inter-ministerial coordination, inadequate monitoring, clientelism, weak accountability and alleged political bias. Given the heightened profile of cash transfers in Brazil's social policy agenda, key questions need to be asked. These concern, firstly, the extent to which Bolsa Famlia does indeed contribute to poverty alleviation; and secondly, whether it creates greater dependence of the poor on government hand-outs and political patronage at the expense of long-term social investment for development.

The Impact of a Conditional Cash Transfer Programme on Consumption in Colombia,"This paper studies the impact of a conditional cash transfer programme in Colombia on the total consumption of very poor households and on its components. Our evaluation methodology involves comparing household expenditures in areas in which the programme was not implemented (control) and those in which it was (treated). We use a quasi-experimental approach, as the Familias en Accion programme was not randomly assigned across localities, for political reasons. We condition on a large range of household- and municipality-level characteristics, and also control for preprogramme differences in the outcomes of interest using a differences-in-differences methodology. We find that the programme has been effective at greatly increasing total consumption and its main component, food consumption, in both rural and urban areas. The programme has also contributed to improvements in the quality of food consumed, in particular of items rich in proteins (milk, meat and eggs) and of cereals. Furthermore, the programme has created redistributive effects in favour of children through expenditure on education and children's clothing, while it has not significantly affected consumption of adult goods such as alcohol and tobacco or adults' clothing."," Attanasio, OrazioInstitute for Fiscal Studies, UK and U College LondonInstitute for Fiscal Studies, UKOrazioOrazio AttanasioAttanasioAttanasio, Orazio , Mesnard, AliceAliceAlice MesnardMesnardMesnard, Alice",http://search.proquest.com/docview/56751207?accountid=14496," Welfare, Well-Being, and Poverty: Government Programs, Provision and Effects of Welfare Programs (I38) , Microeconomic Analyses of Economic Development (O12) , Economic Development: Human Resources, Human Development, Income Distribution, Migration (O15) , Colombia , Latin America and the Caribbean , Poor , Transfers",EconLit,2006
Child Health in Rural Mexico: Has Progresa Reduced Children's Morbidity Risks?,"It is well known that ill health during early childhood can have deleterious consequences for future developmental outcomes. Furthermore, children growing up in poverty are at risk of experiencing frequent and severe episodes of illness because they are highly exposed to the risk factors associated with catching infectious diseases. Progresa, Mexico's main anti-poverty programme, aims to support and promote parents living in rural areas to invest in children's education, health and nutrition. Poorer unhealthy children in remote rural areas have limited access to health care. This paper investigates whether this rural intervention improved children's health status during its first three years of operation. We examine whether Progresa reduces children's morbidity risks by looking at the changes over time in the incidence of diarrhoea and acute respiratory infections. Additionally, we assess whether there are differential treatment effects according to households' severity of poverty. The analyses of this study have been carried out using longitudinal data from a randomized treatment and control survey. Our results indicate that there is some evidence that Progresa contributes to reducing morbidity rates. We find that for both diseases under study, the Programme effect is mainly due to a decrease in the morbidity risks of children aged between 24 and 59 months. However, the evidence of a Programme effect is stronger for diarrhoea than for respiratory infections. Tables, Figures, References.

Non-Cooperative Households And The Size And Composition Of Public Expenditure,"This paper presents a model in which the composition and size of public spending are determined through a political process. Agents differ in wage rates, and live in households positively sorted by wage; household production benefits both partners but the partners interact non-cooperatively, hence the laissez-faire equilibrium is inefficient. There are three policy tools, a labour income tax rate, a cash transfer and an in-kind transfer. The latter can be combined with household production to generate a household public good. All agents agree on some form of public intervention to remedy the inefficiency, but low-wagers prefer high taxes and cash transfers, while high-wagers prefer low taxes and in-kind provision. Under the empirically plausible assumption that voting participation is positively correlated with income, the equilibrium policy will be of the sort preferred by voters with above-mean income. This effect is accentuated by increased inequality.

Transferencias directas vs inyecciones sectoriales: Un analisis estructural del combate a la pobreza. (With English summary.),"The extreme poverty and agricultural crisis in Mexico are issues widely considered by public opinion and policymakers in recent years. Considering that budget constraints imply the choice of alternative policies, in this paper, we analyze two feasible policies and their effects: a)an injection to the agricultural sector and b) direct cash transfers to households with the lowest income. First, we analyze redistributive effects, then the decomposition of multiplicative effects and, finally, we carry out a structural path analysis to study in detail the transmission of effects. Results, obtained using a Social Accounting Matrix of Mexico for 1996, suggest that direct cash transfers to households, may have more important multiplicative and redistributive effects than those generated by an equivalent injection on the agricultural sector."," Nunez, GasparCentro de Investigaciones Socioeconomicas, U Autonoma de CoahuilaU Autonoma de BarcelonaGasparGaspar NunezNunezNunez, Gaspar , Polo, ClementeClementeClemente PoloPoloPolo, Clemente",http://search.proquest.com/docview/56919518?accountid=14496," Taxation and Subsidies: Externalities, Redistributive Effects, Environmental Taxes and Subsidies (H23) , Welfare, Well-Being, and Poverty: Government Programs, Provision and Effects of Welfare Programs (I38) , Economic Development: Agriculture, Natural Resources, Energy, Environment, Other Primary Products (O13) , Economic Development: Human Resources, Human Development, Income Distribution, Migration (O15) , Agricultural Policy, Food Policy (Q18) , Mexico , Latin America and the Caribbean , Poverty , Redistributive Effects , Transfers",EconLit,2007
Return to Sender,"Last year, migrants sent home nearly $300 billion in remittances, or three times the world's total foreign-aid budget. The cash transfers have proven to be an unprecedented economic boon to many developing nations.

State government cash and in-kind benefits: intergovernmental fiscal transfers and cross-program substitution,"US states provide both cash and health insurance benefits for the poor, partially financed by fiscal transfers from the Federal government. The 1996 welfare reform drastically reduces Federal support for cash transfers at the margin, lowering the relative price to states of providing benefits to the poor through Medicaid. This paper analyzes the comparative-statics response of state governments to such changes in intergovernmental transfers, showing (in central cases) that they can contribute not only to reductions in state expenditures on cash benefits but to increases in expenditures on Medicaid, whether or not beneficiary populations are mobile among states.

Demand and Supply-Side Determinants of Conditional Cash Transfer Program Effectiveness,"The Programa Nacional de Becas Estudiantiles is a conditional cash transfer program designed to promote human capital accumulation and reduce poverty among Argentine youth. This study follows a 1999 cohort of students for five years and uses matching methods with a comparison group of students excluded due to quotas to estimate average and marginal program impacts. Multilevel methods are used to explore the role of program management and execution in explaining variation between schools in student outcomes. The results suggest that the Becas program improved students' attendance and performance, in part through program conditions requiring good attendance and academic progress for continued scholarship receipt."," Heinrich, Carolyn JU WICarolynCarolyn J HeinrichHeinrichJHeinrich, Carolyn J",http://search.proquest.com/docview/56707405?accountid=14496," Analysis of Education (I21) , Measurement and Analysis of Poverty (I32) , Fertility, Family Planning, Child Care, Children, Youth (J13) , Economic Development: Human Resources, Human Development, Income Distribution, Migration (O15) , Argentina , Latin America and the Caribbean , Human Capital , Poverty , Youth",EconLit,2007
"Conditional Cash Transfers, Public Provision of Private Goods, and Income Redistribution","This paper examines the role of cash transfers as a screening device when combined with in-kind transfers. It shows that linking in-kind to cash transfers makes first-best redistribution possible despite the government's inability to tell rich and poor individuals apart. Moreover, the maximal attainable welfare for the poor can be pushed beyond its first-best level by distorting downward the quality of the indivisible good the poor receive relative to the cash value of their net transfers. Using in-kind transfers alone, as in Besley and Coate (1991), leads to a third-best solution."," Gahvari, FirouzU ILGetulio Vargas FoundationFirouzFirouz GahvariGahvariGahvari, Firouz , Mattos, EnlinsonEnlinsonEnlinson MattosMattosMattos, Enlinson",http://search.proquest.com/docview/56701081?accountid=14496," Taxation and Subsidies: Externalities, Redistributive Effects, Environmental Taxes and Subsidies (H23) , Public Goods (H41) , Redistribution",EconLit,2007
From food aid to livelihoods support: rethinking the role of WFP in eastern Sudan,"Despite more than 20 years of distribution of free emergency food in eastern Sudan (38 years in the case of refugees) Global Acute Malnutrition rates are currently the highest in the country. There has been no real improvement in the chronic livelihoods vulnerability that affects people in the region -- particularly pastoralists. Food security must be seen from an informed livelihoods perspective. While food aid may still be required as part of transition, WFP must rethink its assistance strategy and advocate for complementarity in the efforts by development actors working across a range of sectors. Alternative models and interventions focused on the rehabilitation of markets and the development of 'cargo nets' for the destitute, including cash transfers, must be developed and tested. Land tenure issues should be given particular attention. Food aid will probably remain an important element in the overall response, but its significance relative to other less developed forms of interventions should be reassessed. References.

Reform of in-kind benefits in Russia: high cost for a small gain,"Summary Based on national legislation passed in the summer of 2004, Russia implemented wide-ranging changes to its system of category-based social benefits in January 2005. Implementation difficulties made headlines around the world. This article discusses the structure of the reforms and examines the extent to which they: (a) reduce or eliminate the categorical allocation of public resources; (b) replace in-kind benefits with cash transfers; and (c) target benefits, in whatever form, to low-income people. The overall conclusions are that the reforms score very badly against criteria (a) and (c), but get a middling score for cashing-out benefits.

"Measuring The Lifetime Redistribution Achieved By Dutch Taxation, Cash Transfer And Non-Cash Benefits Programs","This paper assesses how the Dutch system of taxation, cash transfers and non-cash benefits redistributes between the rich and the poor. The approach in this paper deviates from the usual approach by incorporating the full life cycle in the measurements, rather than only the annual effects. Moreover, the coverage is larger than is usually the case: the paper takes account of both direct and indirect taxes and direct and indirect benefits. In order to obtain the measurements on redistribution, we use the level of educational attainment to classify the population. We therefore measure, in terms of present values, the average net benefit from government policies for an average representative person of each level of education. The results indicate a sizable redistribution from the rich to the poor and a significant reduction of welfare inequality. The net effect on welfare inequality is, however, substantially smaller than when measured on an annual basis.

Unintended effects of poverty programmes on childbearing in less developed countries: Experimental evidence from Latin America,"Because conditional cash transfer (CCT) programmes (which make payments to poor households, conditional on their behaviour) potentially affect both household resource levels and parental preferences for quality vs. quantity of children, they may have unintended consequences for fertility. We use panel data from experimental CCT programmes in three Latin American countries to assess the unintended impact of these programmes on childbearing. Our findings, based on difference-in-difference models, show that the programme in Honduras, which inadvertently created large incentives for childbearing, may have raised fertility by between 2 and 4 percentage points. The CCT programmes in the two other countries, Mexico and Nicaragua, did not have the same unintended incentives for childbearing, and in these countries we found no net impact on fertility. Subsequent analysis examined several potential mechanisms by which fertility in Honduras may have been raised but was not able to identify a primary mechanism with the available data.

"Food aid, domestic policy and food security: contrasting experiences from South Asia and sub-Saharan Africa","Food aid, both for short-term emergency relief and as program food aid that helps address medium-term food ''deficits'', is often a major component of food security strategies in developing countries. This study reviews the experience with food aid of four major recipients of food aid (India, Bangladesh, Ethiopia and Zambia) regarding food production, trade, markets, consumption and safety nets, as well as the policy responses to food emergencies. The widely varying experiences of the study countries suggest that food aid that supports building of production and market enhancing infrastructure, is timed to avoid adverse price effects on producers, and is targeted to food insecure households can play a positive role in enhancing food security. However, food aid is not the only, or in many cases, the most efficient means of addressing food insecurity. In many cases private markets can more effectively address shortfalls in food availability and cash transfers may be a viable alternative to food transfers in-kind.

Poverty Alleviation and Consumption Insurance: Evidence from PROGRESA in Mexico,"This study uses three rounds of panel data between October 1998 and November 1999 and covering 506 villages and 24,000 households in rural Mexico, to examine how the replacement of pre-existing subsidy programs by a conditional cash transfer program such as PROGRESA (the Health, Education and Nutrition Program) affects the consumption insurance of households. The results obtained are consistent with the prevalence of formal or informal insurance arrangements aimed at protecting household consumption from fluctuations in income. Yet, total consumption, as well as food and nonfood consumption, are significantly correlated with idiosyncratic changes in income suggesting that insurance is incomplete. A comparison of the results between villages covered and not yet covered by PROGRESA (treatment versus control villages) suggests that PROGRESA did not replace or reinforce any pre-existing risk sharing among households within villages or lead to any substantial changes in how households cope with shocks. The analysis also revealed that households eligible for the PROGRESA benefits in the treatment villages were able to insulate their consumption from fluctuations in income better than their counterparts in control villages. Thus, a poverty alleviation program providing cash transfers conditioned on households investing in their human capital is associated with a reduction of household vulnerability to risk."," Skoufias, EmmanuelWorld BankEmmanuelEmmanuel SkoufiasSkoufiasSkoufias, Emmanuel",http://search.proquest.com/docview/56632371?accountid=14496," Taxation and Subsidies: Externalities, Redistributive Effects, Environmental Taxes and Subsidies (H23) , Welfare, Well-Being, and Poverty: Government Programs, Provision and Effects of Welfare Programs (I38) , Economic Development: Human Resources, Human Development, Income Distribution, Migration (O15) , Mexico , Latin America and the Caribbean , Education , Health , Nutrition , Poverty Alleviation , Poverty , Subsidy , Transfers",EconLit,2007
"Mortality risks, education and child labor","In this paper, we investigate the role of young adult mortality on child labor and educational decisions. We argue that mortality risks are a major source of risks in returns to education in developing countries. We show that, in the absence of appropriate insurance mechanisms, the level of child labor is inefficient, but it can be too high or too low. It is too high when parents are not very altruistic and anticipate positive transfers from their children in the future. Uncertain returns to education, endogenous mortality or imperfect capital markets unambiguously increase child labor. When the level of child labor is inefficiently high, we also show that a cash transfer conditional on child's schooling can always restore efficiency regarding child labor.

Multilateral Lending Institutions and Transnational Policy Networks in Mexico and Chile,"The impact of economic globalization for the countries of Latin America was profoundly shaped by the impact of the debt crisis of the early 1980s. For these countries, the emergence of transnational policy networks involving multilateral & domestic technocrats was instrumental in ushering in market reforms. By 2007, a variety of factors would seem to place middle-income countries such as Mexico & Chile beyond the policy reach of multilateral lending institutions. I argue, however, that the Inter-American Development Bank & the World Bank have, in fact, become closely entangled in the development of conditional cash transfer programs through closed transnational policy networks. The nature & extent of that involvement has been shaped by the different institutional legacies & cultures of the two institutions. While both multilaterals tended to bolster the objectives of domestic policymakers & the exclusion of civil society organizations from the policy process, the greater rhetorical commitment of the World Bank to civil society participation did allow civil society organizations to pry open a small space for policy inclusion in the Chilean case.

Based on that property, CCTPs might be extended to provide a more comprehensive and cohesive social protection umbrella.

Conditional Cash Transfers As Social Policy in Latin America: An Assessment of Their Contributions and Limitations,"Conditional cash transfer programs have recently spread throughout Latin America, and early findings suggest their potential to overcome poverty and create human capital. This review undertakes an assessment of CCT programs and the conventional theory that has evolved to justify them.

Love on the Rocks: Domestic Violence and Alcohol Abuse in Rural Mexico,"I use experimental data for the evaluation of Oportunidades to study the determinants of domestic violence and alcohol abuse. The program, a combination of cash transfers to women and human capital investments, decreases husbands' alcohol abuse by 15% and changes their aggressive behavior depending on transfer size, husbands' education, and spousal age gap. While small transfers decrease violence by 37% for all households, large transfers increase the aggressive behavior of husbands with traditional views of gender roles, probably because their wife's entitlement to a large transfer threatens their identity. This evidence rejects standard unitary, collective, and bargaining models for this latter group of households. It also shows that, while targeting women as recipients of micro-credit or other welfare programs may have additional beneficial effects by reducing alcoholism and domestic violence in most households, the risk of violence may increase for some."," Angelucci, ManuelaU AZManuelaManuela AngelucciAngelucciAngelucci, Manuela",http://search.proquest.com/docview/56872054?accountid=14496," Welfare, Well-Being, and Poverty: Government Programs, Provision and Effects of Welfare Programs (I38) , Marriage, Marital Dissolution, Family Structure, Domestic Abuse (J12) , Economics of Gender, Non-labor Discrimination (J16) , Illegal Behavior and the Enforcement of Law (K42) , Formal and Informal Sectors, Shadow Economy, Institutional Arrangements (O17) , Economic Development: Urban, Rural, Regional, and Transportation Analysis, Housing, Infrastructure (O18) , Mexico , Latin America and the Caribbean , Entitlements , Gender , Rural , Transfers , Welfare , Welfare Program , Women",EconLit,2008

Cash Transfers Contributing to Social Protection: A Review of Evaluation Findings,"The positive effects of conditional cash transfer programmes (CCTs) in Latin America have led to the recommendation that CCTs should be promoted. This may be premature since there is not much knowledge about the critical factors that have led to the positive results. Areas suffering from humanitarian crises, insufficient food supply and poor connection to the nearby markets should not be considered for cash transfer programmes. Several policy implications are identified: (1) The implications of conditionality should be carefully assessed before embarking on these types of programmes as they tend to exclude the most vulnerable groups. (2) One will usually get more poverty reduction for the budget by using broad targeting. (3) Gender equality should be a part of the overall design.

The child support grant as a means of addressing child poverty: South African experiences in the post-apartheid era,"In this paper says that South Africa has introduced a child support grant as a poverty alleviation measure to specifically target poor children. This is a means-tested, cash transfer paid to the primary caregiver of the child up to the age of 14. This article analyses the child support grant and examines whether it is indeed addressing child poverty. The extent of child poverty in South Africa is described and the child support grant is discussed in the context of the South African economic and social security systems. The impact of the grant is assessed by means of a review of relevant literature and research. The results of the literature review indicate that despite concerns that the child support grant is not reaching the country's poorest children, it has made good progress in improving the lives of children and that nearly eight million children now receive the grant. Evidence is emerging that the grant positively impacts on the nutritional status and school attendance of children. The means test and the requirement that children have identity documents are identified as obstacles to the implementation of the grant and the article concludes by examining an alternate recommendation by many concerned parties in South Africa that the child support grant be replaced by a universal basic income grant.

"Blacks, Whites or Greys? Conditional Transfers and Gender Equality","To what extent do conditional cash transfer (CCT) programs, the ""star"" programs of the new generation of Latin American public policy, promote or inhibit greater degrees of gender equality? Using a novel theoretical-empirical tool for the study of gender equality, & based on primary & secondary information, our analysis compares three countries with contrasting welfare regimes, Chile, Costa Rica & El Salvador. In terms of gender equality, although CCT programs are based on assumptions that exacerbate the historical division of labor between women & men, they can also debilitate it.

Mikrofinans Sistemi ve Ticari Bankalarin Mikrofinans Sistemindeki Yeri. (Microfinance System and the Place of Commercial Banks in Microfinance System. With English summary.),"Currently, approximately one fifth of the world's population try to live with less than 1 dollar per day and the challenge with the poverty becomes more important as time goes on. Microfinance system, which becomes important while challenging with poverty, consists of financial services and credits for poor people in order to work for their own living and discover their potentials. Microfinance system, which came into the scene with the presentation of micro credit service in the years of 1970s, was made broader as a result of being understood that poor people needs for financial services such as savings, insurance, and cash transfer services rather than loans. As new institutions are established, the service spectrum of microfinance is expanded that is to say there is a diversification of financial products. As a matter of fact, since the years of 1990s while nongovernmental organizations transform into commercial banks or specialized financial institutions, commercial banks also began to present microfinance services by using different models. In this study, microfinance system, successful microfinance institutions that transformed from nongovernmental organizations to commercial banks and models of commercial banks using to present microfinance services are examined in order to provide contribution to microfinance applications in Kyrgyzstan."," Oner, EmineGazi UGazi UGazi UGazi UEmineEmine OnerOnerOner, Emine , Okan, PinarPinarPinar OkanOkanOkan, Pinar , Gokten, SonerSonerSoner GoktenGoktenGokten, Soner , Aypek, NevzatNevzatNevzat AypekAypekAypek, Nevzat",http://search.proquest.com/docview/855188145?accountid=14496," Banks, Depository Institutions, Micro Finance Institutions, Mortgages (G21) , Measurement and Analysis of Poverty (I32) , Economic Development: Human Resources, Human Development, Income Distribution, Migration (O15) , Economic Development: Financial Markets, Saving and Capital Investment, Corporate Finance and Governance (O16) , LDCs , Turkey , Europe , Bank , Commercial Banks , Credit , Financial Institution , Financial Service , Microfinance , Poor , Population , Poverty",EconLit,2008
"Women's Power, Conditional Cash Transfers, and Schooling in Nicaragua","The Social Safety Net (Red de Proteccion Social, RPS) program in Nicaragua is one of many conditional cash transfer programs that pay households cash stipends in exchange for school attendance and regular visits to health clinics by the children. A key feature is that payments go to the female head of household. Previous research suggests that exogenous transfers to women are more likely to be spent on their children's health, nutrition, and education and thus to reinforce the goals of these programs. Randomized experimental data from RPS are used to test for heterogeneous program impacts on school enrollment and spending based on a woman's power, as proxied by her years of schooling relative to her husband's years of schooling. The results confirm previous findings that more household resources are devoted to children when women are more powerful. However, when a woman's power greatly exceeds her husband's, additional female power reduces school enrollment. RPS impacts on schooling are much larger than the expected income effects estimated from the control group, although no evidence is found that female power alters the impact of RPS on school enrollment. The conditionality of RPS is probably decisive. While RPS significantly increases food and education expenditures, the impact is attributable primarily to income effects.

Do welfare benefits affect women's choices of adult care giving?,"This article tries to analyse the effects of old age and disability benefits on women's decisions to allocate time to adult care giving. More specifically, it evaluates the welfare neutrality of proposals oriented by preference theory in favour of cash transfers instead of services provision. Cross-sectional and event history analysis techniques are used with pooled European household panel data and aggregated indicators of public spending on old age and disability benefits. The article arrives at two main conclusions: (i) non-mean-tested provision of benefits lowers the risk of heavy adult care giving among all women, while means-tested benefits have no significant effect on poor women's behaviour, and (ii) providing services is more efficient than cash transfers in reducing women's probability of allocating many hours to adult care.

The President's 'New' Constituency: Lula and the Pragmatic Vote in Brazil's 2006 Presidential Elections,"The 2006 presidential elections in Brazil witnessed a dramatic shift of Lula's voting base away from the more developed regions of the country and towards the poorest areas. This paper uses municipal-level data to argue that while this shift represents an important change for the support base of Lula himself, it can mostly be explained by the government's massive cash transfer programme, the Bolsa Familia, and by the empirical regularity with which presidential candidates from the incumbent party in Brazil always perform better in the less developed regions of the country.

Upstream solutions: does the supplemental security income program reduce disability in the elderly?,"Context: The robust relationship between socioeconomic factors and health suggests that social and economic policies might substantially affect health, while other evidence suggests that medical care, the main focus of current health policy, may not be the primary determinant of population health. Income support policies are one promising avenue to improve population health. This study examines whether the federal cash transfer program to poor elderly, the Supplemental Security Income (SSI) program, affects old-age disability. Methods: This study uses the 1990 and 2000 censuses, employing state and year fixed-effect models, to test whether within-state changes in maximum SSI benefits over time lead to changes in disability among people aged sixty-five and older. Findings: Higher benefits are linked to lower disability rates. Among all single elderly individuals, 30 percent have mobility limitations, and an increase of $100 per month in the maximum SSI benefit caused the rate of mobility limitations to fall by 0.46 percentage points. The findings were robust to sensitivity analyses. First, analyses limited to those most likely to receive SSI produced larger effects, but analyses limited to those least likely to receive SSI produced no measurable effect. Second, varying the disability measure did not meaningfully alter the findings. Third, excluding the institutionalized, immigrants, individuals living in states with exceptionally large benefit changes, and individuals living in states with no SSI supplements did not change the substantive conclusions. Fourth, Medicaid did not confound the effects. Finally, these results were robust for married individuals. Conclusions: Income support policy may be a significant new lever for improving population health, especially that of lower-income persons. Even though the findings are robust, further analyses are needed to confirm their reliability. Future research should examine a variety of different income spport policies as well as whether a broader range of social and economic policies affect health.

Redistributive conflict and social policy in Latin America,"Inequality has been a long-standing feature of Latin America. This article is an examination of the redistributive and social policy struggles in two countries of the region: Mexico and Chile. While electoral democracy has propelled redistributive issues onto the policy agenda, redistributive struggles are intense and progress in policy to address inequality is slow to emerge. Attention has been focused on cash transfer programs because of their ability to garner approval from a cross-section of public opinion, particularly from the most powerful. While such programs have an important contribution to make to poverty reduction, societal redistributive compromises are essential to an efficacious strategy to reduce poverty and inequality over the long term.

Mitigating Distributional Impact of Fuel Pricing Reform: The Indonesian Experience,"In 2005, the Indonesian government implemented a massive fuel price increase. While the benefits of the reform on efficiency grounds have been widely acknowledged, there is still debate about whether the reform was equitable. That question is answered in this paper using a Computable General Equilibrium (CGE) model with disaggregated households that allows for a rich and accurate distributional story. Analysis of various counter-factual scenarios analysis of the reform is carried out. It suggests that the reform could have been progressive if it increased only vehicle fuel prices. However, it tends to increase inequality especially in urban areas when the price of domestic fuel (kerosene) is also increased. Proper and effective compensation is important in mitigating the distributional cost or poverty impact of the reform. A uniform cash transfer to poor households that disregards poor households' heterogeneity tends to over-compensate the rural poor but under-compensate the urban poor."," Yusuf, Arief AnshoryPadjadjaran UAustralian National UAriefArief Anshory YusufYusufAnshoryYusuf, Arief Anshory , Resosudarmo, Budy PBudyBudy P ResosudarmoResosudarmoPResosudarmo, Budy P",http://search.proquest.com/docview/56785480?accountid=14496," Welfare, Well-Being, and Poverty: General (I30) , Mining, Extraction, and Refining: Hydrocarbon Fuels (L71) , Microeconomic Analyses of Economic Development (O12) , Economic Development: Human Resources, Human Development, Income Distribution, Migration (O15) , Economic Development: Urban, Rural, Regional, and Transportation Analysis, Housing, Infrastructure (O18) , Planning Models, Planning Policy (O21) , Urban, Rural, Regional, Real Estate, and Transportation Economics: Regional Migration, Regional Labor Markets, Population, Neighborhood Characteristics (R23) , Indonesia , Asia , Computable General Equilibrium , Fuel , Poor , Poverty , Rural , Urban",EconLit,2008
How Cash Transfers Promote the Case for Basic Income,"There has long been a minority view that providing people with cash is an effective way of combating poverty and economic insecurity while promoting livelihoods and work. The mainstream view has nevertheless been that giving people money, without conditions or obligations, promotes idleness and dependency, while being unnecessarily costly. This paper reviews recent evidence on various types of schemes implemented in developing countries, including several pilot cash transfer schemes, assessing them by reference to principles of social justice. It concludes that experience with cash transfers is strengthening the case for a universal basic income."," Standing, GuyU Bath and Monash UGuyGuy StandingStandingStanding, Guy",http://search.proquest.com/docview/56744964?accountid=14496," Measurement and Analysis of Poverty (I32) , Welfare, Well-Being, and Poverty: Government Programs, Provision and Effects of Welfare Programs (I38) , Transfers",EconLit,2008

Cash transfers to tackle childhood poverty and vulnerability: an analysis of Peru's Juntos programme,"Social programmes in Peru have been plagued historically by a culture of dependency, clientelism and corruption. Juntos, a conditional cash transfer programme targeting children under the age of 14, was initiated in 2005 to provide a new model for social protection provision and tackle the country's widespread childhood poverty. Its design largely follows that of counterpart Latin American programmes and seeks to address the risks to children's future human capital development that stem from inadequate access to basic services and various forms of social exclusion. An innovative dimension of Juntos is its explicit focus on populations most affected by the country's political violence during the 1980s and 1990s. Drawing on document analysis and qualitative field research, this independent assessment considers the impacts of the programme on childhood poverty, the strengths and weaknesses of a conditional approach, and changes in intra-household and community dynamics as well as state-citizen relations. It concludes by discussing policy challenges and directions for future research.

Avaliando Resultados de um Programa de Transferencia de Renda: O Impacto do Bolsa-Escola sobre os Gastos das Familias Brasileiras. (With English summary.),"The aim of this work is to analyze the effects of cash transfers of public programs on household's expenditures and their components, taking the Brazilian program Bolsa-Escola as a representative example. It is used a non experimental method called propensity score matching, with microdata from the Pesquisa de Orcamentos Familiares (POF) 2002-2003. Further, a sensitivity analysis is carried to certify that the propensity score model is well specified and still works in the presence of unobservable variables. Results suggest a positive effect of cash transfers on the poor beneficiary household's consumption. The fact that household's expenditures are concentrated on education, hygiene products, clothing, and general food instead of drinks, cigarettes, and durable goods means that, at some level, the money transferred is being efficiently spent. Hence, the increased consumption of the observed households enhances their welfare, which means an immediate relief from poverty conditions."," Resende, Anne Caroline CostaRoyal Holloway College, U LondonFederal U Minas Gerais and CEDEPLARResende, Anne Caroline Costa , de Oliveira, Ana Maria Hermeto Camilode Oliveira, Ana Maria Hermeto Camilo",http://search.proquest.com/docview/56769073?accountid=14496," Consumer Economics: Empirical Analysis (D12) , Taxation and Subsidies: Externalities, Redistributive Effects, Environmental Taxes and Subsidies (H23) , Welfare, Well-Being, and Poverty: Government Programs, Provision and Effects of Welfare Programs (I38) , Microeconomic Analyses of Economic Development (O12) , Economic Development: Human Resources, Human Development, Income Distribution, Migration (O15) , Brazil , Latin America and the Caribbean , Education , Expenditure , Households , Poor , Poverty , Transfers , Welfare",EconLit,2008

The results ratify the hypothesis proposed that the families whose head works as an independent worker show higher probability for the occurrence of child labor than those whose head works as a formal salaried worker. Among other results, it must be highlighted, making simulations, that increasing parents' schooling is more efficient than augmenting income to reduce the use of child labor.

Multiple Dimensions of Social Assistance: The Case of Peru's 'Glass of Milk' Programme,"Social assistance has attracted renewed interest in countries where economic growth is doing too little on its own to address high levels of income inequality and poverty. Research into the material effects of such programmes is important but can be misleading if it fails to capture their full meaning to intended beneficiaries and other stakeholders. This is illustrated by a case study of Peru's 'glass of milk' programme, drawing on mostly qualitative evidence of its material, social and cultural dimensions. The programme is found to be well adapted to diverse contexts, but in a way that enhances its efficacy as a gendered instrument of mass patronage rather than as a means of addressing Peru's structural inequalities. The paper also suggests that a switch to conditional cash transfers is unlikely, on its own, to change this.

Why do Beneficiaries Leave the Safety Net in Mexico? A Study of the Effects of Conditionality on Dropouts,"Background Many governments have implemented conditional cash transfer (CCT) programmes with the goal of improving options for poor families through interventions in health, nutrition, and education. Families enrolled in CCT programmes receive cash in exchange for complying with certain conditions: preventive health requirements and nutrition supplementation, education, and monitoring designed to improve health outcomes and promote positive behaviour change. Our aim was to disaggregate the effects of cash transfer from those of other programme components. Methods In an intervention that began in 1998 in Mexico, low-income communities (n=506) were randomly assigned to be enrolled in a CCT programme (Oportunidades, formerly Progresa) immediately or 18 months later. In 2003, children (n=2449) aged 24-68 months who had been enrolled in the programme their entire lives were assessed for a wide variety of outcomes. We used linear and logistic regression to determine the effect size for each outcome that is associated with a doubling of cash transfers while controlling for a wide range of covariates, including measures of household socioeconomic status. Findings A doubling of cash transfers was associated with higher height-for-age Z score (^D*b 0DT20, 95% CI 0DT09-0DT30; p<0DT0001), lower prevalence of stunting (-0DT10, -0DT16 to -0DT05; p<0DT0001), lower body-mass index for age percentile (-2DT85, -5DT54 to -0DT15; p=0DT04), and lower prevalence of being overweight (-0DT08, -0DT13 to -0DT03; p=0DT001). A doubling of cash transfers was also associated with children doing better on a scale of motor development, three scales of cognitive development, and with receptive language. Interpretation Our results suggest that the cash transfer component of Oportunidades is associated with better outcomes in child health, growth, and development.

National Immunization Day: a strategy to monitor health and nutrition indicators,"Problem: To achieve the Millennium Development Goals it is necessary to set up low-cost, real-time monitoring systems which can provide feedback to managers and policy-makers in a timely fashion. The gold-standard approach for monitoring nutritional situations is to conduct household surveys. However, they are costly, time consuming and do not furnish information about smaller disaggregated units. Approach: Brazil pioneered National Immunization Days (NIDs) in the 1980s, and later integrated them with vitamin A supplementation. This report discusses implementation of five large-scale Health and Nutrition Days (HNDs) using NIDs as a platform to monitor nutritional status and estimate coverage of health and social welfare services, including conditional cash transfer benefits. Local setting: Brazil is composed of 26 states, one federal district and 5564 municipalities, with around 18 million children under five years of age. It was decided that HNDs would be carried out among high-risk populations: children from the semi-arid northeastern region, agrarian reform settlements; isolated rural black communities or quilombolas and municipalities of Amazonas state. Relevant changes: It was possible to draw inferences for almost 3 million children from different subgroups of underprivileged populations who had never before been studied in such detail, including state-level data. Lessons learned Implementation of large scale HNDs in conjunction with NlDs proved to be feasible in Brazil and resulted in data which are very relevant for policy-makers, obtained over a short period of time and at reasonably low cost. It is sensible to conclude that the experience reported here could be reproduced wherever NID coverage is very high.

Securing decent work and living conditions in low-income urban settlements by linking social protection and local development: a review of case studies,"A majority of people now live in cities. Countries need to accommodate such a rapidly growing urban population, which is often living and working informally, and which is lacking access to decent working and living conditions. By integrating economic promotion policies with social protection instruments public policies not only mitigate the effects of social risks on poverty, particularly in low-income settlements, but also create the necessary conditions to allow the poor to work out of poverty. Some international organizations including the International Labour Office (ILO) consider that low-income countries can afford a basic package of social benefits. In face of growing informalization of the labour force worldwide, universal and targeted social cash transfers to poor people, which are not related to their employment status, are contributing today to curb poverty and reduce inequality in a number of developing countries. But, for poor people in petty jobs, poor housing and living conditions, social and economic rights are indivisible. Case studies show how social protection and local development in urban areas can be combined to achieve progressive universal coverage. These studies provide evidence that workers and families, who need to secure and enhance their vulnerable household economies, can largely benefit from measures that aim to extend further the reach of social protection. A major challenge lies in breaking down the conceptual and administrative barriers that artificially oppose economic development and social protection, in order to reduce the costs of the access to productive and basic social services and remove hurdles to local development in urban areas.

Ex Ante Evaluation of Social Programs,"This paper discusses methods for evaluating the impacts of social programs prior to their implementation. Ex ante evaluation is useful for designing programs that achieve some optimality criteria, such as maximizing impact for a given cost. This paper illustrates the use of behavioral models in predicting the impacts of hypothetical programs in a way that is not functional form dependent. Among the programs considered are wage subsidy programs, conditional cash transfer programs, and income support programs. In some cases, the behavioral model justifies a completely nonparametric estimation strategy, even when there is no direct variation in the policy instrument. In other cases, stronger assumptions are required to evaluate a program ex ante. We illustrate the application of ex ante evaluation methods using data from the PROGRESA school subsidy randomized experiment in Mexico. We assess the effectiveness of the ex ante prediction method by comparing predictions of program impacts to the impacts measured under the randomized experiment. The subsamples pertain to girls and boys aged 12-15.

Bolsa Familia and the Needy: Is Allocation Contributing to Equity in Brazil?,"This paper examines whether the Brazilian social programme Bolsa Familia is contributing to greater social equality within the country. As a measure of success, we rely on the programme's impact on public-school enrolment, which we consider an input for social equity. Our findings show that policy makers should continue with the same system of allocation used in 2006, which proved to be contributing to greater social equality. We suggest policy maker's direct attention to the 2006 residual map depicting municipalities that have extremely over- and under-predicted values, which may represent misallocation of public funds, and therefore may require some scrutiny.

The Run on Rice,"Examines causes of the current rise in food prices, particularly for rice, & considers what might done about it. Some explanations that have been advanced are rejected, eg, growth in demand for crops as food, production shortfalls, neoliberal free trade reforms. While rising energy & fertilizer prices & the falling dollar have contributed to world food price increases, it is contended that the biggest single contributor to this rise is government policy encouraging the production & use of biofuels. How rice is impacted indirectly by this is explained in terms of the link between biofuels & wheat. Further, high rice prices are seen as a function of the unintended consequences of the policies of major rice exporting & importing countries. After briefly looking at how these prices are hitting the poor, attention is given to four types of policy responses to the sudden price surge: (1) targeted cash transfers to protect the most vulnerable; (2) trade, tax, & subsidy policies to reduce domestic prices; (3) more efficient food production policies; & (4) international cooperation to address global sources of the problem.

Survey of recent developments,"The 10th anniversary of Soeharto's resignation was coloured by disappointment with the slowness of reform, and with the government's reluctance to confront blatant religious intolerance. Nevertheless, economic growth is strong and investment spending buoyant. Inflation has risen well above target, suggesting that a more effective approach to monetary policy is needed. The recent surge in global rice prices coincided with bountiful domestic harvests, putting the government under pressure to restrict rice exports rather than imports as it has in recent years. However, restricting exports has been recognised as a 'starve thy neighbour policy', and the ASEAN trade ministers have jointly agreed 'to continue fair trade practices and to achieve an orderly regional rice trade'. The government has at last increased domestic fuel prices significantly, mind-ful of the waste of valuable resources and the inequity involved in keeping such prices constant in the face of world price increases. It will implement a cash transfer program to compensate the poor for the resulting increase in living costs. The Ministry of Finance is leading reform of the central government bureaucracy. Its most fundamental initiatives are in human resource management, where it is attempting to match remuneration to skill requirements and responsibilities, and to align the pay structure more closely with that in the private sector - with pay rates rising much more rapidly than hitherto as levels of responsibility increase. It is also encouraging competition to fill vacancies by advertising them internally, rather than continuing to rely on promotion by seniority. At local government level, a small number of heads of government have gained a reputation as pioneers of reform.

From Structural Adjustment to Social Adjustment: A Gendered Analysis of Conditional Cash Transfer Programmes in Mexico and Nicaragua,"The article explores the implications for gender roles and relations in Nicaragua of implementing a Conditional Cash Transfer programme aimed at improving the situation of the extreme poor. Nicaragua's programme, the Social Protection Network/Red de Proteccion Social (RPS), is modelled on the Progresa/Oportunidades programme of Mexico and shares many features in common. Evaluations of Progresa have suggested positive outcomes for women. However, examination of the findings highlight some cause for concern particularly around what inclusion on the programme means for the women involved. The article explores the consequences of translating this programme aimed at addressing the structural causes of poverty into a more overtly neoliberal and neo-conservative policy context such as that in Nicaragua. It highlights how a key feature of the RPS is the 'social adjustment' of women's behaviour for economic growth gains and discusses the possible consequences for the women included and excluded from the programme.

Brazil's Bolsa familia: a double-edged sword?,"In common with most Latin American countries, as governments embrace safety nets to attack poverty, conditional cash transfer (CCT) programmes have become part of mainstream social policy in Brazil. Under president Fernando Henrique Cardoso (1995-2002), and especially since Luiz Incio Lula da Silva took office in 2003, targeted assistance in education, health and nutrition, now united under Bolsa Famlia, have expanded rapidly to benefit forty-four million (24 per cent of the total population), absorbing almost two-fifths of the social assistance budget earmarked for the poorest sectors. Despite its operational problems, Bolsa Famlia appears to have been effective in providing short-term relief to some of the most deprived groups in Brazil. Yet it could prove to be a double-edged sword. There is a risk that, due to its popularity among both the poor and Brazil's politicians, Bolsa Famlia could greatly increase patronage in the distribution of economic and social benefits and induce a strong dependence on government handouts. There are also early signs that it may be contributing to a reduction in social spending in key sectors such as education, housing and basic sanitation, possibly undermining the country's future social and economic development.

Women Beneficiaries or Women Bearing the Cost? A Gendered Analysis of the Red de Proteccion Social in Nicaragua,"Conditional Cash Transfer programmes aim to alleviate short-term poverty through cash transfers to poor households, and to reduce longer-term poverty through making these transfers conditional on household investment in the health and education of children. These programmes have become increasingly popular with institutions such as the World Bank. However, the need for conditionalities has been questioned on a number of levels, including its necessity: it has been suggested that the cash transfer in itself may be sufficient to secure most of the programme's wider aims. The example of Nicaragua supports this contention, demonstrating that only a small incentive is needed to bring the desired changes in the uptake of education, since this is something prized by the poor themselves. In health, the Nicaraguan case suggests that demand-side initiatives might not be as important as supply-side changes that improve the affordability and accessibility of services. The Nicaragua case also highlights the long-term limitations of applying such programmes in countries with high levels of poverty and low economic growth. A gendered analysis of the programme highlights the fact that women 'beneficiaries' bear the economic and social cost of the programme without apparent benefit to themselves or even necessarily to the household in the short or longer term.

Rights Issues in China as Evidence for the Existence of Two Types of Agency Problems,"This paper identifies the existence of two kinds of agency problem focusing on rights issues by Chinese firms. It begins by examining the context in which state-designated managers are strongly encouraged by the government to provide funds for its use, often at the expense of their companies' interests. The statistics presented in this paper further show how Chinese managers transfer these cash funds, raised from their public shareholders, via rights issues, to the state as cash dividends. An empirical examination of 459 rights issues by Chinese firms from 1999 to 2004 shows how Chinese managers have inflated their earnings prior to rights issues in order to gain regulatory permission and thus process the cash transfers more smoothly. This is evidence of the first type of agency problem: managers behaving in a way that is against the interests of their shareholders. In addition, during rights issues, existing shareholders can purchase new shares at lower prices and as a result there is a substantial drop in both the firm s share price and its returns. Wealth reallocation from the nation to subscribed shareholders occurs during this period, which implies that state-designated managers disregard this obligation to safeguard national assets. This practice is a sign of the second type of agency problem: Chinese state-designated managers violating the national interest for the sake of their own self-interest.

Overcoming the zero interest-rate bound: a quantitative prescription,"Using a macro-econometric model we provide a quantitative estimate of the cash transfer or tax cut that would achieve recovery from a severe recession when the central bank is unable to achieve full recovery because of the zero bound. We introduce an automatic transfer and simulate its triggering in the severe recession. We find that an automatic transfer that averages 3% of quarterly GDP repeated four times (quarterly) reduces the unemployment rate an additional full percentage point and thereby completes the recovery. We recommend that legislatures enact an automatic counter-cyclical fiscal policy that will assure adequate stimulus without generating a long-term debt problem.

Tracking the Transition from Welfare to Work,"One of the primary goals of the 1996 federal welfare reform legislation was to reduce dependency on cash transfers and to promote self-sufficiency through employment in the paid labor force. This pa per draws upon a qualitative study of 18 Iowa welfare recipients and tracks changes that occur over a three-year, post-reform period. Thick descriptions highlight the internal family dynamics of the choices made over time. The purposes of the study are twofold: first, to document changes in family composition, employment, housing, and program participation, and second, to report how recipients experience such changes. Findings reveal that the 11 families who left the cash benefit program were usually still dependent on Food Stamps, Medicaid, and other need-based programs to supplement family income. Income sources within families were often one or two low-wage jobs, Supplemental Security Income (SSI) or Social Security Disability Income (SSDI) payments. In addition, chronic health problems plagued most families still receiving cash benefits, and those cycling on and off cash benefits experienced frequent changes in employment and/or family composition.

How carbon credits could drive the emergence of renewable energies,"The shift to renewable energy options and low-carbon technologies, in response to the concerns over energy security and climate change, is proceeding more slowly than many would like. The usual argument against rapid deployment of new technologies is the costs imposed on the economy, commonly interpreted in terms of upfront costs to be borne or involving large cash transfers to fund, for example, efforts to preserve rainforests. In this contribution I argue that such a perspective provides a continuing barrier to taking effective action, whereas a perspective based on creation and use of carbon credits provides a means of avoiding the shock of abrupt industrial change. Carbon credits granted for bona fide carbon load reductions could be created through private initiative, for example by merchant banks, to constitute a market that will complement regulatory-based initiatives such as national emissions trading systems. This is not a novel idea; indeed it is the way that capitalism has funded every major change, including the Industrial Revolution, through the creation of credit. The emergence of a global carbon credit economy is likely to precede a global regulatory system governing climate change and will doubtless help to stimulate the emergence of such a global system.

Doing a bit more for the poor? Social assistance in Latin America,"Social assistance programmes involving cash transfers to poor and vulnerable households have become a major focus of development policy in recent years. This article compares the experiences of three such programmes in Latin America: Oportunidades in Mexico, Jefes y Jefas de Hogares in Argentina, and Brazil's social pension. Particular attention is given to each programme's administrative effectiveness, as well as their impacts on poverty, human capital, and household and gender dynamics. More broadly, the article assesses whether these schemes live up to their billing as 'best practice' for developing countries, and how they relate to wider shifts in the political economy of welfare provision. It concludes that experiences have been mixed, that claims about positive outcomes are sometimes exaggerated, and that the potential of these programmes to substantially re-orientate welfare systems and promote equitable public policies remains limited.

The Value of Non-Work Time in Cross-National Quality of Life Comparisons: The Case of the United States vs. the Netherlands,"Comparisons of wellbeing between the United States and Western Europe generally show that most Americans have higher standards of living than do Western Europeans at comparable locations in their national income distributions. These comparisons of wellbeing typically privilege disposable income and cash transfers while ignoring other aspects of welfare state and labor market structure that potentially affect the distribution of wellbeing in a society. We argue that non-work time is such a factor. In this empirical exercise involving the United States and the Netherlands, we show that reasonable estimates of the contribution to wellbeing from non-market activities such as the raising of children or longer vacations can overturn claims in the literature that the United States offers greater wellbeing to more of its citizens than do western European countries.

Labor Supply Responses to Large Social Transfers: Longitudinal Evidence from South Africa,"We quantify the labor supply responses of prime-aged adults to the presence of pensioners in their households, using longitudinal data collected in South Africa. We compare households and individuals before and after pension receipt and pension loss, which allows us to control for a host of unobservable household and individual characteristics that may determine labor market behavior. We find large cash transfers to the elderly lead to increased employment among prime-aged adults, which occurs primarily through labor migration. The pension's impact is attributable to the increase in household resources it represents, which can be used to stake migrants until they become self-sufficient, and to the presence of pensioners who can care for small children, which allows prime-aged adults to look for work elsewhere."," Ardington, CallyU Cape TownPrinceton ULondon School of Hygiene and Tropical MedicineCallyCally ArdingtonArdingtonArdington, Cally , Case, AnneAnneAnne CaseCaseCase, Anne , Hosegood, VictoriaVictoriaVictoria HosegoodHosegoodHosegood, Victoria",http://search.proquest.com/docview/56865003?accountid=14496," Taxation and Subsidies: Externalities, Redistributive Effects, Environmental Taxes and Subsidies (H23) , Social Security and Public Pensions (H55) , Welfare, Well-Being, and Poverty: Government Programs, Provision and Effects of Welfare Programs (I38) , Time Allocation and Labor Supply (J22) , Economic Development: Human Resources, Human Development, Income Distribution, Migration (O15) , Elderly , Labor Markets , Labor Migration , Labor Supply , Migrant , Migration , Pension , Transfers",EconLit,2009
Inequality in Argentina. A Revision of the Empirical Evidence,"This article documents the changes in the income distribution in Argentina from the mid-70s to the mid-2000s. Over the period inequality increased substantially. Two types of episodes shaped this upward trend: deep macroeconomic crises and periods of sudden and intense economic liberalization.

The depth and speed of the reforms and the scarcity of public policies to ease the transition contributed to the particular severity of the income distribution changes. The macro crises and the subsequent recoveries contributed to the volatility of inequality along this upward trend.

The large macroeconomic crisis of 2001/02 triggered a large jump in inequality, although income disparities returned to pre-crisis levels as the economy recovered fast, and large cash transfer programs were implemented."," Cruces, GuillermoUniversidad Nacional de La PlataGuillermoGuillermo CrucesCrucesCruces, Guillermo , Gasparini, LeonardoUniversidad Nacional de La PlataLeonardoLeonardo GaspariniGaspariniGasparini, Leonardo",http://search.proquest.com/docview/743786510?accountid=14496," 6489 , 4200 10902 , 12434 , 13143 13682 , 12616 12622 , 10472 , 6274 3641 12233 , 7585 4025 , 3904 , 4935 7372 3893 3921 9653 11783 , 24 386 14",International Bibliography of the Social Sciences (IBSS),2009
Developments in national policies for food and nutrition security in Brazil,"Brazil is on track to achieve many of the Millennium Development Goals, and this is widely credited to bold and innovative government policies backed by new forms of popular participation in social policy. This article examines evaluation evidence on two of the most important recent initiatives in Brazil's policies for food and nutrition security (conditional cash transfers through Bolsa Famlia and support for family agriculture through the Programa de Aquisio de Alimentos). It also considers advances in older policies (such as the School Meals programme) and the work of the National Council for Food and Nutrition Security, which has culminated in national legislation establishing food and nutrition security as a right.

"In-School Labour Supply, Parental Transfers, and Wages","In many industrialised countries, teenagers have a significant spending power, and they are important customers for specialised industries. The income of teenagers still in full time education comes from two major sources: parental pocket money and earnings from part-time jobs. Little is known about the way these sources interact, and how they depend on parental, school, and family characteristics. In this paper, we analyse labour supply of 16 year old British teenagers together with the cash transfers made to them by their parents. We first develop a theoretical model, where labour supply and transfers are jointly determined. We then estimate labour supply and transfers jointly, using unique data on labour supply of teenagers, the wages they receive, and the transfers from their parents. We show how these two processes depend on each other, and how transfers and labour supply react to changes in wages."," Dustmann, ChristianU College LondonU SouthamptonTilburg UChristianChristian DustmannDustmannDustmann, Christian , Micklewright, JohnJohnJohn MicklewrightMicklewrightMicklewright, John , van Soest, ArthurArthurArthur van Soestvan Soestvan Soest, Arthur",http://search.proquest.com/docview/56975174?accountid=14496," Fertility, Family Planning, Child Care, Children, Youth (J13) , Time Allocation and Labor Supply (J22) , Wage Level and Structure, Wage Differentials (J31) , U.K. , Europe , Earnings , Labor Supply , Part Time , Teenager , Wage",EconLit,2009
Economic Crisis and its Social Impacts: Lessons from the 1997 Asian Economic Crisis,"The objective of this paper is to survey the social consequences of the 1997 Asian financial crisis with the purpose of drawing policy lessons. The outbreak of the financial crisis and the ensuing increase in unemployment and poverty triggered a worsening of education and health outcomes. The situation stabilized and eventually improved only after governments and international organizations intervened. Employment creation and cash transfers programs played a positive role in maintaining income, while education and health care programs helped meet the population's vital education and health care needs.

Economic Shocks in Education: Analysis of the 1997 Asian Financial Crisis and Lessons for Today,"Studies of the 1997 Asian financial crisis suggest that impacts of economic shocks on education are ambiguous and vary according to gender, income and location. The crisis exacerbated previous disparities, with gaps between girls and boys, and urban and rural education widening. Secondary school enrolment sustained the greatest impact. Countries' high commitment to education, as evidenced by increased household expenditures and government social protection programmes, helped protect education. Lessons from 1997 serve as a useful framework for considering potential policy responses to the 2007-08 crisis. Getting policies right is important given the current education landscape, where disparities continue to persist. The paper provides an analysis of the state of education in East Asia and the Pacific. It then analyzes experiences from the 1997 crisis and government policy responses since 1997. It argues that quick and sustained action is important. Social protection measures should be institutionalized to prepare for future crises.

Kenya's cash transfer program: Protecting the health and human rights of orphans and vulnerable children,"In Kenya, as in other countries of sub-Saharan Africa heavily burdened by HIV/AIDS, orphans and vulnerable children (OVC) face poverty and despair. There is an urgent need to provide a comprehensive response that supports families and communities in their efforts to care for children and safeguard their rights. The government of Kenya has established a cash transfer program that delivers financial and social support directly to the poorest households containing OVC, with special concern for those children with or affected by HIV/AIDS. The Kenyan effort builds on lessons drawn from research and program development on cash transfers in Latin America, Asia, and Africa, and the Kenyan program offers an opportunity to examine the challenges faced by Kenya, and its responses in the context of international experiences. This paper - based on observation of and interviews with key actors involved in the origins, development, evaluation, and continued strengthening of Kenya's cash transfer program and on the analysis of technical program documents obtained from those key actors - describes the Kenyan cash transfer program in light of human rights issues as they relate to children's health. It offers one example of how caring for society's most vulnerable members is a collective responsibility to be shared by a country's government, local citizens, and the international community.

Empowering women to obtain high quality care: evidence from an evaluation of Mexico's conditional cash transfer programme,"Objective To evaluate the impact of Mexico's conditional cash transfer programme on the quality of health care received by poor women. Quality is measured by maternal reports of prenatal care procedures received that correspond with clinical guidelines. Methods The data describe retrospective reports of care received from 892 women in poor rural communities in seven Mexican states. The women were participating in an effectiveness study and randomly assigned to incorporation into the programme in 1998 or 1999. Eligible women accepted cash transfers conditional on obtaining health care and nutritional supplements, and participated in health education sessions. Results Oportunidades beneficiaries received 12.2% more prenatal procedures compared with non-beneficiaries (adjusted mean 78.9, 95% Confidence Interval (CI): 77.5-80.3; P < 0.001). Conclusion The Oportunidades conditional cash transfer programme is associated with better quality of prenatal care for low-income, rural women in Mexico. This result is probably a manifestation of the programme's empowerment goal, by encouraging beneficiaries to be informed and active health consumers.

Competing visions of democracy and development in the era of neoliberalism in Mexico and Chile,"This article takes as its starting point the current scholarly concern with democratic quality, poverty, and inequality. It notes the tendency of political leaderships at the federal level in Mexico and Chile to exclude political pressures that contravene their neoliberal imperatives. It develops this argument with specific reference to the contestation over conditional cash transfer programs. Research reveals the existence of two competing visions of democracy and development at the root of this conflict. The neoliberal perspective is supported by political-technocratic leaders who developed these programs, while the community development perspective is found among their civil society critics. The community development perspective challenges the key tenets of the neoliberal viewpoint, making its exclusion from policy development and monitoring understandable. However, this exclusion may give rise to increased criticism of the responsiveness of democratic institutions and to less than efficacious policy outcomes.

Household Targeting In Practice: The Nicaraguan Red De Proteccion Social,"This article describes the details underlying the targeting of a Nicaraguan anti-poverty program, emphasising the rationale for how it was designed and implemented. It offers, by way of example, a guide for targeting in an anti-poverty program, and highlights some of the potential tradeoffs. It then goes on to present a quantitative assessment of how well the program was able to target poor households. A combination of ad hoc and statistical procedures led to targeting that was effective, with undercoverage rates of 10 per cent or below and leakage rates of 15 per cent or below. This was in spite of the fact that the targeting methodologies used were imprecise at both the household and geographic levels.

A Decade of Poverty Reduction Strategies in Latin America: Empowering or Disciplining the Poor?,"This article assesses the social impacts of three poverty reduction strategies in Latin America, drawing on the experiences of Nicaragua, Honduras, and Bolivia. It demonstrates that the Latin American Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP) experience has thus far resulted in little gains in poverty reduction, despite strong emphasis in all three PRSPs on innovative social policy tools and programs, especially the conditional cash transfer programs (CCTs), in operation in each county. It argues that the PRSP architecture represents an attempt to deepen the hegemony of neoliberal policies in developing countries, by selectively combining coercive (increased conditionality and monitoring) with consensual (better inclusion) political strategies. What is more, the macro-structural elements of disciplinary neoliberalism are, under the PRSP approach, increasingly complemented by various micro-political policing tools for regulating and monitoring the behaviour of the poor, especially through CCTs. Hence, neoliberal development policy has become ever more intrusive and interventionist as the prevalence of micro-conditionalities to regulate the behaviour of the poor has become a normal practice in international development cooperation.

Avoiding Governors: The Success of Bolsa Familia,"The central hypothesis derived in this article is that the ability of Brazil's central government to bypass governors determined the success of delivering public goods federation-wide in the area of noncontributory social protection policy. The Workers' Party's (Partido dos Trabalhadores) first-term administration from 2003 to 2 006 successfully reformed, expanded, & implemented four previously existing cash-transfer programs designed to alleviate poverty. The central administration s flagship program Bolsa Familia was implemented in all of Brazil's municipalities, delivering benefits to more than 11 million households. A nonmajoritarian political system, the constitutional autonomy of municipalities, & the gradual hardening of post-1995 subnational budget constraints facilitated the ability of the central government to live up to the aspirations & expectations of the Brazilian public by combating hunger, poverty, & misery through this program. This article shows these institutional factors to have provided incentives for successful central-local collaboration in this social policy area. Tables, Figures, References.

Conditionality in public policy targeted to the poor: promoting resilience?,"This paper explores the role of conditionality in policies targeting the poor. By requiring beneficiaries to send their children to school and to undertake regular health visits, proponents argue, conditionalities improve human capital outcomes, promoting resilience. This widespread perception has led to the adoption of conditional cash transfers in many countries. Yet policy debate on conditionality does not always reflect a full appreciation of how behavioural, administrative and political economy variables influence outcomes. This paper identifies the multiple channels through which conditionality determines human capital outcomes and reviews the evidence on linkages between conditionality and processes of resilience.

"Conditional Cash Transfers in Brazil, Chile and Mexico: Impacts upon Inequality","We decompose changes in the Gini coefficient to investigate whether the conditional cash tranfers (CCT) have had an inequality reducing effect in three Latin American countries: Brazil, Mexico, and Chile. We conclude that CCT programs helped reducing inequality between the mid-1990s and the mid-2000s. The share of total income represented by the CCTs is very small, less than 1%. But as their targeting is outstanding, the equalising impact of CCTs was responsible for about 21% of the fall in Brazilian and Mexican inequality figures In Chile the effect was responsible for around 15% of the reduction."," Soares, SergeiIPEAInternational Poverty Centre, UN Development ProgramIPEAIPEACarnegie Endowment for International PeaceSergeiSergei SoaresSoaresSoares, Sergei , Osorio, Rafael GuerreiroRafaelRafael Guerreiro OsorioOsorioGuerreiroOsorio, Rafael Guerreiro , Soares, Fabio VerasFabioFabio Veras SoaresSoaresVerasSoares, Fabio Veras , Medeiros, MarceloMarceloMarcelo MedeirosMedeirosMedeiros, Marcelo , Zepeda, EduardoEduardoEduardo ZepedaZepedaZepeda, Eduardo",http://search.proquest.com/docview/56941794?accountid=14496," Personal Income, Wealth, and Their Distributions (D31) , Taxation and Subsidies: Externalities, Redistributive Effects, Environmental Taxes and Subsidies (H23) , Welfare, Well-Being, and Poverty: Government Programs, Provision and Effects of Welfare Programs (I38) , Economic Development: Human Resources, Human Development, Income Distribution, Migration (O15) , Brazil , Chile , Mexico , Latin America and the Caribbean",EconLit,2009
Indirect Effects of an Aid Program: How Do Cash Transfers Affect Ineligibles' Consumption?,"Cash transfers to eligible households indirectly increase the consumption of ineligible households living in the same villages. This effect operates through insurance and credit markets: ineligible households benefit from the transfers by receiving more gifts and loans and by reducing their savings. Thus, the transfers benefit the local economy at large; looking only at the effect on the treated underestimates the impact.

Care regimes and national employment models,"Rapid population ageing has dramatically increased the social and economic cost of elderly care. As a consequence of the search for cost effectiveness/reduction we observe a convergence in how the care market is organised: all countries are moving towards home care, private provision and cash transfers. The aim of this paper is twofold. It is argued that the way in which elderly care is provided and financed may entail considerable differences in the creation of a formal care market. National employment models in turn shape the features of the care labour market, affecting both the quantity and quality of care labour supply, the extent of the care labour shortage, and the degree of dependence on migrant carers. This paper presents a comparative analysis of various European country models of elderly care to show how these two factors combine to shape the characteristics of elderly care regimes, and their differing capacity to meet increasing demand for care either by using native workers or, alternatively, by turning to immigrant workers in order to cope with labour shortages.

Illness-Related Impoverishment in Rural South Africa: Why Does Social Protection Work for Some Households but Not Others?,"Illness is a major risk to people's livelihoods in resource-poor settings, particularly where there are rising levels of chronic illness. Measures that improve access to treatment are increasingly seen as a vital form of social protection for vulnerable households, and central to the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals. International attention is also focused on cash transfers as a strand of social protection, and on the potential complementarities between free health care and cash transfers in assisting vulnerable people to cope with illness-related shocks. South Africa provides an interesting setting to examine how households are accessing social protection measures because the government has removed some user fees, implemented hospital-level exemptions, and extended cash transfers including the non-contributory pension and child support grant. This paper presents findings from household research in rural South Africa. Qualitative and quantitative methods were used to assess the links between illness-related costs and impoverishment over time, the protection effects of free health services, cash transfers and social networks, and the factors influencing access to these three forms of social protection. Different degrees of success in drawing on these resources affected capacity to cope with illnesses and made a considerable difference to whether households sustained their livelihoods, struggled or declined. Cash transfers combined well with free health care to build resilience among some households. However, households without access to at least two strands of the social protection net were impoverished by the direct and indirect costs of long-term illnesses. The implications for policies on improving the uptake and coverage of social protection measures are discussed."," Goudge, JaneU WitwatersrandU WitwatersrandU Witwatersrand and U LondonU WitwatersrandU WitwatersrandU LondonJaneJane GoudgeGoudgeGoudge, Jane , Russell, StevenStevenSteven RussellRussellRussell, Steven , Gilson, LucyLucyLucy GilsonGilsonGilson, Lucy , Gumede, TebogoTebogoTebogo GumedeGumedeGumede, Tebogo , Tollman, SteveSteveSteve TollmanTollmanTollman, Steve , Mills, AnneAnneAnne MillsMillsMills, Anne",http://search.proquest.com/docview/56926712?accountid=14496," Health Production (I12) , Health: Government Policy, Regulation, Public Health (I18) , Urban, Rural, Regional, Real Estate, and Transportation Economics: Household Analysis: General (R20) , Economic Sociology, Economic Anthropology, Social and Economic Stratification (Z13) , South Africa , Africa , Health , Health Care , Social Networks",EconLit,2009

"Contraceptive Use, Birth Spacing, and Autonomy: An Analysis of the Oportunidades Program in Rural Mexico","Oportunidades, a conditional cash-transfer program instituted in Mexico in 1997, provides cash incentives to mothers to invest in the health and education of family members. Drawing from data gathered by Mexico's National Institute of Public Health, this study assesses the effect of the program on contraceptive use and birth spacing among titulares (female household heads) living in rural areas during the experimental period, 1998-2000, and during 2000-03, after incorporation of the control group. In 2000, titulares were more likely to use modern contraceptives than were women in the control group, although by 2003 all beneficiaries had the same probability of use. Change in autonomy was not a mediator, although baseline autonomy modified the program's influence on contraceptive use. Cox proportional hazard models produced estimates that birth spacing was similar between the beneficiaries and controls. Inconsistent findings may be the result of the way contraceptive use was defined in this study. Findings from this study may be useful for helping program planners better understand the role of conditional cash transfers in modifying family planning and fertility among poor rural women in Latin America."," Feldman, Becca SHebrew U Jerusalem and Hadassah Medical Center, JerusalemHarvard UHarvard UU MIHarvard UBeccaBecca S FeldmanFeldmanSFeldman, Becca S , Zaslavsky, Alan MAlanAlan M ZaslavskyZaslavskyMZaslavsky, Alan M , Ezzati, MajidMajidMajid EzzatiEzzatiEzzati, Majid , Peterson, Karen EKarenKaren E PetersonPetersonEPeterson, Karen E , Mitchell, MarcMarcMarc MitchellMitchellMitchell, Marc",http://search.proquest.com/docview/56916276?accountid=14496," Analysis of Health Care Markets (I11) , Health: Government Policy, Regulation, Public Health (I18) , Fertility, Family Planning, Child Care, Children, Youth (J13) , Economics of Gender, Non-labor Discrimination (J16) , Economic Development: Human Resources, Human Development, Income Distribution, Migration (O15) , Mexico , Latin America and the Caribbean , Birth , Contraceptive , Education , Family Planning , Female , Fertility , Health , Mothers , Poor , Public Health , Women",EconLit,2009
Participation in a School Incentive Programme in India,"Education policy has recently focused on improving accountability and incentives of public providers for actual learning outcomes, often with school-based reward programmes for high performers. The Learning Guarantee Programme in Karnataka, India, is prominent among such efforts, providing cash transfers to government schools that achieve learning at specified high levels. This study examines whether schools that self-selected into the incentive programme are different than those that did not. The answer has important implications for how to evaluate the impact of such a programme. Although we find no significant differences in resources and characteristics, we do find significant and substantial differences in test scores prior to selection into the programme, with better performing schools more likely to opt-in. These findings also provide insight into how incentive-based programmes that focus on levels of (rather than changes in) achievement can exacerbate inequality in education. Failing schools, since they are more likely to opt-out of incentive programmes, are likely to require other targeted programmes in order to improve. In addition, our findings reinforce the value of randomised controlled trials to evaluate incentive programmes since evaluations that rely on matching schools based on resources (if, for instance, pre-programme test scores are unavailable) will be biased if resources poorly predict test scores.

The sizeable rise in inequality in the 1990s seems to be associated to reallocations against unskilled-labor intensive sectors, and to skilled-biased technological change within most sectors, both factors stimulated by the process of economic integration. The depth and speed of the reforms and the scarcity of public policies to ease the transition contributed to the particular severity of the income distribution changes. The macro crises and the subsequent recoveries contributed to the volatility of inequality along this upward trend. The large macroeconomic crisis of 2001/02 triggered a large jump in inequality, although income disparities returned to pre-crisis levels as the economy recovered fast, and large cash transfer programs were implemented."," Cruces, GuillermoCEDLAS, National U La Plata and CONICETCEDLAS, National U La PlataGuillermoGuillermo CrucesCrucesCruces, Guillermo , Gasparini, LeonardoLeonardoLeonardo GaspariniGaspariniGasparini, Leonardo",http://search.proquest.com/docview/57018352?accountid=14496," Personal Income, Wealth, and Their Distributions (D31) , Business Fluctuations, Cycles (E32) , Taxation and Subsidies: Externalities, Redistributive Effects, Environmental Taxes and Subsidies (H23) , Macroeconomic Analyses of Economic Development (O11) , Economic Development: Human Resources, Human Development, Income Distribution, Migration (O15) , Argentina , Latin America and the Caribbean , Crisis , Distribution , Income , Income Distribution , Inequality , Macroeconomics",EconLit,2009
Schooling Impacts of Conditional Cash Transfers on Young Children: Evidence from Mexico,"Examines the educational impacts of the Oportunidades program, which links monetary transfers to human capital investments of poor children & family members, on children, ages 0-8 in 1997 or ages 6-14 in 2003, in Mexico.

Symposium: Impacts of the Oportunidades Program: Schooling Impacts of Conditional Cash Transfers on Young Children: Evidence from Mexico,"This article evaluates impacts of Oportunidades, a Mexican conditional cash transfer program, on educational outcomes 5.5 years after program initiation for a group of children who were ages 0-8 years preprogram. The oldest children within this age range received educational scholarships. The youngest children did not receive the scholarships because they had not yet started the third grade (the initial grade for scholarships) but were beneficiaries of the program's health components, which included nutritional supplements for children 24 months of age or younger. All of these children also may have benefited more generally from increased household income resulting from the program. This article investigates how the program differentially affected younger and older children within this age range and examines whether the early nutritional intervention led to improvements in subsequent educational performance. The program impact estimates are derived from a randomly assigned treatment and control group, which participated for different lengths of time in the program, and from a matched comparison group that had not participated prior to the collection of data in 2003. The empirical findings show positive program impacts on reducing ages at entering school for the younger children as well as on accumulated grades of schooling after 5.5 years of benefits for older children, with estimates implying a 1% reduction in the age of entry to primary and an increase in grades of schooling completed to date of about 8%-9%."," Behrman, Jere RU PACIDE-CAMBSU PAJereJere R BehrmanBehrmanRBehrman, Jere R , Parker, Susan WSusanSusan W ParkerParkerWParker, Susan W , Todd, Petra EPetraPetra E ToddToddETodd, Petra E",http://search.proquest.com/docview/56887167?accountid=14496," Taxation and Subsidies: Externalities, Redistributive Effects, Environmental Taxes and Subsidies (H23) , Analysis of Education (I21) , Welfare, Well-Being, and Poverty: Government Programs, Provision and Effects of Welfare Programs (I38) , Fertility, Family Planning, Child Care, Children, Youth (J13) , Economic Development: Human Resources, Human Development, Income Distribution, Migration (O15) , Mexico , Latin America and the Caribbean , Children , Health , Schooling , Transfers",EconLit,2009

"Symposium: Impacts of the Oportunidades Program: Investments, Time Preferences, and Public Transfers Paid to Women","The literature suggests that men and women may have different preferences. This paper exploits a social experiment in which women in treatment households were given a large public cash transfer (PROGRESA). In an effort to disentangle the effect of additional income in the household from the effect of changing the distribution of income within the household, the impact of PROGRESA income on savings and investments decisions is compared with all other income sources (after taking into account participation in the program). Additional money in the hands of women is spent on small livestock (which are traditionally managed and cared for by women), improved nutrition, and child goods (particularly clothing). Among single-headed households, PROGRESA income is not treated differently from other income. Direct evidence on intertemporal preferences gathered in the Mexican Family Life Survey indicates that women are more patient than men when thinking about the future. Taken together, the results suggest that PROGRESA income results in a shift in the balance of power within households and that women allocated more resources toward investments in the future."," Rubalcava, LuisCentro de Analisis y Medicion del Bienestar Social and CIDE, Mexico CityU IberoamericanaDuke ULuisLuis RubalcavaRubalcavaRubalcava, Luis , Teruel, GracielaGracielaGraciela TeruelTeruelTeruel, Graciela , Thomas, DuncanDuncanDuncan ThomasThomasThomas, Duncan",http://search.proquest.com/docview/56888949?accountid=14496," Taxation and Subsidies: Externalities, Redistributive Effects, Environmental Taxes and Subsidies (H23) , Welfare, Well-Being, and Poverty: Government Programs, Provision and Effects of Welfare Programs (I38) , Economics of Gender, Non-labor Discrimination (J16) , Microeconomic Analyses of Economic Development (O12) , Economic Development: Human Resources, Human Development, Income Distribution, Migration (O15) , Mexico , Latin America and the Caribbean , Distribution , Nutrition , Transfers , Women",EconLit,2009
Symposium: Impacts of the Oportunidades Program: Impact of Oportunidades on Skilled Attendance at Delivery in Rural Areas,"Oportunidades (formerly PROGRESA) is a conditional cash transfer program ran by the Mexican federal government designed to break the intergenerational cycle of poverty. Among other activities, it provides free delivery attendance for women enrolled in the program. Skilled attendance at delivery has been identified as an effective strategy to reduce maternal mortality, an important health problem in Mexico. In this paper we assess the impact of Oportunidades on skilled attendance at delivery taking advantage of the experimental design implemented for the evaluation of this program in rural areas and using a variety of analytical techniques. The main results of the study indicate that Oportunidades had, at best, only a small effect on skilled attendance at delivery in treatment communities. The program had larger effects on those women who had one birth just prior to the experimental treatment and another birth subsequent to the experimental treatment. These results should lead to a review about the strategies used by Oportunidades to increase skilled attendance at delivery."," Urquieta, JoseInstituto Nacional de Salud PublicaU NCClemson UInstituto Nacional de Salud PublicaInstituto Nacional de Salud PublicaJoseJose UrquietaUrquietaUrquieta, Jose , Angeles, GustavoGustavoGustavo AngelesAngelesAngeles, Gustavo , Mroz, ThomasThomasThomas MrozMrozMroz, Thomas , Lamadrid-Figueroa, HectorHectorHector Lamadrid-FigueroaLamadrid-FigueroaLamadrid-Figueroa, Hector , Hernandez, BernardoBernardoBernardo HernandezHernandezHernandez, Bernardo",http://search.proquest.com/docview/56888427?accountid=14496," Taxation and Subsidies: Externalities, Redistributive Effects, Environmental Taxes and Subsidies (H23) , Health Production (I12) , Welfare, Well-Being, and Poverty: Government Programs, Provision and Effects of Welfare Programs (I38) , Fertility, Family Planning, Child Care, Children, Youth (J13) , Economics of Gender, Non-labor Discrimination (J16) , Economic Development: Human Resources, Human Development, Income Distribution, Migration (O15) , Mexico , Latin America and the Caribbean , Birth , Health , Mortality , Poverty , Transfers , Women",EconLit,2009

Migrant remittances and inequality in Central-Eastern Europe,"The impact of remittance flows on growth and income distribution has attracted a great deal of attention, but the theoretical and empirical literature on the relationship between remittances and economic development is far from clear. Although there is wide consensus that foreign remittances can help the receiving households to increase income, consumption and capabilities to cope with socioeconomic shocks, there has been little quantitative research on impacts of remittances on household welfare and poverty. Our paper seeks to fill some of these gaps proposing an empirical analysis of the role of remittances as a tool for reducing inequality and covering households against poverty and social exclusion risks. The empirical analysis focuses on four Eastern European Countries: Slovenia, Poland, the Czech Republic and Hungary, and is based on the EU-SILC (European Union Statistics on Income and Living Conditions) 2005 data-set providing for each household information as to the received inter-household cash transfers and among which regular cash support from households in other countries (i.e. remittances) are included. The results show that remittances are statistically significant in terms of poverty reduction even if their effects are generally smaller than those of welfare transfers. Furthermore, the impact of remittances and welfare transfers differ across the countries considered.

Eradicating Diseases: The Effect of Conditional Cash Transfers on Vaccination Coverage in Rural Nicaragua,"Despite significant global efforts to improve vaccination coverage against major childhood diseases, vaccination rates are below 90%. To eradicate diseases such as measles, however, vaccination rates close to 95% are needed. We use a randomized experiment to investigate the effect of a demand incentive, a conditional cash transfer program, in improving vaccination coverage in rural Nicaragua. Double-difference estimates show the program led to large increases in vaccination coverage, and these resulted in vaccination levels greater than 95% for some vaccines. Effects were especially large for children who are typically harder to reach with traditional supply-side interventions."," Barham, TaniaU COMiddlebury CollegeTaniaTania BarhamBarhamBarham, Tania , Maluccio, John AJohnJohn A MaluccioMaluccioAMaluccio, John A",http://search.proquest.com/docview/56955435?accountid=14496," Health Production (I12) , Health: Government Policy, Regulation, Public Health (I18) , Economic Development: Human Resources, Human Development, Income Distribution, Migration (O15) , Nicaragua , Latin America and the Caribbean , Disease",EconLit,2009

Through an ""institutional ethnography"" can be distinguished four differences between these programs: new objectives, components and administrative structure, broadening to urban areas; wider incorporation by ""densification"", and new forms of relationship between beneficiaries and the program. These changes are the result of the outbreak of a ""civic current"", whose policy originally from civil society organizations carried a pro-democratic political project and were in charge of the program since 2001.

"Agricultural Policy, Market Barriers, and Deforestation: The Case of Mexico's Southern Yucatan","This paper examines the linkages between agricultural policies and deforestation in a development frontier of Southern Mexico, focusing on support programs targeted at buffering farmers from structural reforms. We argue that local barriers to market participation condition the responsiveness of farmers to program incentives, thereby constituting a key channel through which agricultural policies impact the environment. An econometric model parameterizes the influence of two programs, PROCAMPO and Alianza para el Campo, on cultivation. Consistent with an economic environment characterized by market barriers, results suggest that program support, even when decoupled from production decisions, significantly determines land use and deforestation.

Building Trust? Conditional Cash Transfer Programmes and Social Capital,"In this paper, we propose a measure of social capital based on behaviour in a public goods game. We conducted a public goods game within 28 groups in two similar neighbourhoods in Cartagena, Colombia, one of which had been targeted for over two years by a conditional cash transfer programme that has an important social component. The level of cooperation we observe in the 'treatment' community is considerably higher than that in the 'control' community. The two neighbourhoods, however, although similar in many dimensions, turn out to be significantly different in other observable variables. The result we obtain in terms of cooperation, however, is robust to controls for these observable differences. We also compare our measure of social capital with other more traditional measures that have been used in the literature."," Attanasio, OrazioU College London and Institute for Fiscal Studies, LondonColombian Department of National Planning and Institute for Fiscal Studies, LondonU Andes and U SienaOrazioOrazio AttanasioAttanasioAttanasio, Orazio , Pellerano, LucaLucaLuca PelleranoPelleranoPellerano, Luca , Polania Reyes, SandraSandraSandra Polania ReyesPolania ReyesPolania Reyes, Sandra",http://search.proquest.com/docview/57025306?accountid=14496," Taxation and Subsidies: Externalities, Redistributive Effects, Environmental Taxes and Subsidies (H23) , Welfare, Well-Being, and Poverty: Government Programs, Provision and Effects of Welfare Programs (I38) , Economic Development: Human Resources, Human Development, Income Distribution, Migration (O15) , Economic Development: Urban, Rural, Regional, and Transportation Analysis, Housing, Infrastructure (O18) , Nonagricultural and Nonresidential Real Estate Markets (R33) , Economic Sociology, Economic Anthropology, Social and Economic Stratification (Z13) , Colombia , Latin America and the Caribbean , Building , Social Capital , Transfers",EconLit,2009
Investment in early childhood in Australia: international comparisons and recent trends,"There is growing recognition that investment by governments on children in their early years is an important part of social policy. However there is currently little information either about how much governments invest on children of different ages, or about what the optimum investment in the early years would look like. Using currently available Australian datasets, this article explores two approaches to estimate the adequacy of investment in early childhood; comparing government expenditure between countries, and analysing one country (in this case Australia) in terms of expenditure over time on children of different ages. We find that, overall, Australia spends more than the average of OECD countries on the early years, but that a much higher proportion of this expenditure is spent on cash transfers to parents rather than on early care and education. Furthermore, spending on the early years has grown proportionately to spending on older children over the past several years. The paper ends with a number of suggestions for further research which will refine the analysis of investment in the early years.

Poverty-alleviation program participation and salivary cortisol in very low-income children,"Correlational studies have shown associations between social class and salivary cortisol suggestive of a causal link between childhood poverty and activity of the stress-sensitive hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenocortical (HPA) system. Using a quasi-experimental design, we evaluated the associations between a family's participation in a large-scale, conditional cash transfer program in Mexico (Oportunidades, formerly Progresa) during the child's early years of life and children's salivary cortisol (baseline and responsivity). We also examined whether maternal depressive symptoms moderated the effect of program participation. Low-income households (income <20th percentile nationally) from rural Mexico were enrolled in a large-scale poverty-alleviation program between 1998 and 1999. A comparison group of households from demographically similar communities was recruited in 2003. Following 3.5 years of participation in the Oportunidades program, three saliva samples were obtained from children aged 2-6 years from intervention and comparison households (n = 1197). Maternal depressive symptoms were obtained using the Center for Epidemiologic Studies-Depression Scale (CES-D). Results were that children who had been in the Oportunidades program had lower salivary cortisol levels when compared with those who had not participated in the program, while controlling for a wide range of individual-, household- and community-level variables. Reactivity patterns of salivary cortisol did not differ between intervention and comparison children. Maternal depression moderated the association between Oportunidades program participation and baseline salivary cortisol in children. Specifically, there was a large and significant Oportunidades program effect of lowering cortisol in children of mothers with high depressive symptoms but not in children of mothers with low depressive symptomatology. These findings provide the strongest evidence to date that the economic circumstances of a family can influence a child's developing stress system and provide a mechanism through which poverty early in life could alter life-course risk for physical and mental health disorders.

Opening Up Pandora's Box: The Effect of Gender Targeting and Conditionality on Household Spending Behavior in Mexico's Progresa Program,"This paper evaluates the behavioral impact of conditionality and gender targeting on spending behavior in the Progresa conditional cash transfer (CCT) program from rural Mexico. Results indicate that transfer income is not spent differently from general income, suggesting that transfers exert only an income effect. In addition, women who have increased control over their extra cash are not significantly more likely to spend it in a 'family-friendly' way than they do household earned income. Both features entail significant costs to beneficiaries and program budgets; our results indicate that further evidence is needed to confidently advocate for their inclusion in cash transfer (CT) programs.

Reducing Corruption in Public Education Programs in Africa: Instruments and Capture in Madagascar,"This paper investigates how the choice of public expenditure instrument is affecting capture in the public education sector. We analyze data on two public funding schemes in Madagascar. We find that there is much more capture of in-kind than of cash transfers. Capture of both instruments declines with better local access to media information and with higher local literacy rates. However, capture of cash grants falls rapidly with a raise in the level of education of the intended beneficiaries, while this effect is significantly weaker for capture of in-kind funds. Our findings suggest that intensive monitoring and increased public access to information should be combined with the right instrument for public funding implementation in order to eradicate capture and corruption."," Francken, NathalieCatholic U Leuven and African Development BankNathalieNathalie FranckenFranckenFrancken, Nathalie",http://search.proquest.com/docview/742845229?accountid=14496," Bureaucracy, Administrative Processes in Public Organizations, Corruption (D73) , National Government Expenditures and Education (H52) , Educational Finance, Financial Aid (I22) , Madagascar , Africa , Corruption , Education , Expenditure , Public Expenditure",EconLit,2009
"Social protection to support vulnerable children and families: the potential of cash transfers to protect education, health and nutrition","Investing in social protection in sub-Saharan Africa has taken on a new urgency as HIV and AIDS interact with other drivers of poverty to simultaneously destabilise livelihoods systems and family and community safety nets. Cash transfer programmes already reach millions of people in South Africa, and in other countries in southern and East Africa plans are underway to reach tens and eventually hundreds of thousands more. Cash transfers worldwide have demonstrated large impacts on the education, health and nutrition of children. While the strongest evidence is from conditional cash transfer evaluations in Latin America and Asia, important results are emerging in the newer African programmes. Cash transfers can be implemented in conjunction with other services involving education, health, nutrition, social welfare and others, including those related to HIV and AIDS. HIV/AIDS-affected families are diverse with respect to household structure, ability to work and access to assets, arguing for a mix of approaches, including food assistance and income-generation programmes. However, cash transfers appear to offer the best strategy for scaling up to a national system of social protection, by reaching families who are the most capacity constrained, in large numbers, relatively quickly. These are important considerations for communities hard-hit by HIV and AIDS, given the extent and nature of deprivation, the long-term risk to human capital and the current political willingness to act.

Social Benefits in Uruguay: Why Do Some Potential Beneficiaries Not Apply?,"Cash transfer programmes have become very important in Latin America. Concerns about proper targeting have centred on excluding people who do not meet eligibility requirements. Less attention has been paid to the failure of programmes to reach the whole of their target population, partly because there are people who do not even apply. The present article analyses the determinants of non-take-up of social benefits. The case studied is the National Social Emergency Plan, an income transfer programme implemented in Uruguay between 2005 and 2007. It is calculated that over a fifth of eligible households have never enrolled in the programme. A probit model is used to estimate the determinants of the decision to apply. The evidence obtained is highly consistent with theoretical and empirical research into the subject."," Burdin, GabrielInstitute of Economics, U Republic, MontevideoInstitute of Economics, U Republic, MontevideoGabrielGabriel BurdinBurdinBurdin, Gabriel , de Melo, GioiaGioiaGioia de Melode Melode Melo, Gioia",http://search.proquest.com/docview/742797073?accountid=14496," Taxation and Subsidies: Externalities, Redistributive Effects, Environmental Taxes and Subsidies (H23) , Welfare, Well-Being, and Poverty: Government Programs, Provision and Effects of Welfare Programs (I38) , Economic Development: Human Resources, Human Development, Income Distribution, Migration (O15) , Uruguay , Latin America and the Caribbean , Income Transfer , Population , Transfers",EconLit,2009
Effectiveness and limitations of the Earned Income Tax Credit for reducing child poverty in the United States,"Based on international comparisons, the United States has a high child poverty rate. The Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC), which provides a tax benefit to low-income working households and was expanded after the 1990s welfare reform, is currently this country's largest cash transfer program for low-income families with children. This article examines the historical components of the EITC. We then analyze the program's child poverty reduction effectiveness by comparing the percent and percentage point declines in the child poverty rate accounted for by the EITC benefit for six years between 1996 and 2005. Figures for the first four years were drawn from previous studies, while figures for the final two years were estimated with a U.S. Census Bureau calculator. All of the analyses used Current Population Survey data. We determined that the percent decline in the child poverty rate attributed to the EITC generally increased during this period (highest percent was 19.5 in 2005), while the percentage point decline remained relatively stable. We then critically examine four poverty reduction assumptions of the EITC that limit its ability to further reduce child poverty and draw social policy implications.

Extending social security to the excluded: are social cash transfers to the poor an appropriate way of fighting poverty in developing countries?,"Formal social security in developing countries has long been centred on employees in the formal sector of the economy. The majority of the population has been excluded. Since the 2000s international organizations have called for extending the coverage of social security.

We find that SCT have spread to all world regions and that SCT covers a highly diverse institutional landscape. Evidence on appropriateness is inconclusive at this early stage of SCT.

Household Structure and Short-Run Economic Change in Nicaragua,"During the economic crises Nicaragua suffered between 2000 and 2002, a conditional cash transfer program targeting poor households began operating. Using panel data on 1,397 households from the program's experimentally designed evaluation, we examined the impact of the program on household structure. Our findings suggest that the program enabled households to avoid reagglomeration during the economic crises, with households in control communities growing more than treated households. These changes were driven primarily by shifts in residence of relatively young men and women with close kinship ties to the household head. In contrast, households that received transfers continued to send off young adult members, suggesting that the program provided resources to overcome the short-term economic pressures on household structure.

The impact of governance on education inequality: evidence from Bangladesh,"Bangladesh has made remarkable progress in increasing education access in the last 20 years. However, substantial inequalities in educational attainment remain even though equity in education is a central government objective. The article argues that weaknesses in education sector governance are crucial to understanding these persistent inequalities. At the level of the budget, anti-poor biases in allocation decisions are shown to be the result of the budget's role in political management and the lack of effective accountability mechanisms. The spearhead of government attempts to address education inequality at the primary level has been the conditional cash transfer programme for poor children. The article shows that the programme has failed to target the poor and suggests that this has been due to the weaknesses and contradictions in the governance of the programme. Strengthening the links between policy and implementation through improvements in the governance of the sector are crucial if inequality is to be addressed and national education goals achieved.

How does parental leave affect fertility and return to work? Evidence from two natural experiments,"This paper analyzes the effects of changes in the duration of paid, job-protected parental leave on mothers' higher-order fertility and postbirth labor market careers. Identification is based on a major Austrian reform increasing the duration of parental leave from one year to two years for any child born on or after July 1, 1990. We find that mothers who give birth to their first child immediately after the reform have more second children than prereform mothers, and that extended parental leave significantly reduces return to work. Employment and earnings also decrease in the short run, but not in the long run. Fertility and work responses vary across the population in ways suggesting that both cash transfers and job protection are relevant. Increasing parental leave for a future child increases fertility strongly but leaves short-run postbirth careers relatively unaffected. Partially reversing the 1990 extension, a second 1996 reform improves employment and earnings while compressing the time between births.

Social interactions and schooling decisions,"The aim of this paper is to study whether a child's schooling choices are affected by the schooling choices of other children. Identification is based on a randomized targeted intervention that grants a cash subsidy conditional on school attendance to a subgroup of eligible children within small rural villages in Mexico (PROGRESA). This policy change spills over to ineligible children tend to attend school more frequently, and the ineligible children acquire more schooling when the subsidy is introduced in their local village. Moreover, the overall effect of PROGRESA on eligible children is the sum of a direct effect due to cash transfers and an indirect effect due to changes in peer group schooling. Interestingly, the social interactions effect is almost as important as the direct effect.

Social policy for poor rural people in Colombia: reinforcing traditional gender roles and identities?,"This article provides a 'situated' gender analysis of the Colombian conditional cash transfer programme, Familias en Accin, offering empirical evidence from a specific rural setting. This 'located' approach shows that generalizations about gender implications of conditional cash transfer programmes in Latin America do not always fit neatly with realities. The article shows how the implementation of these programmes in a specific rural context, the municipality of Paipa, reflects a reinforcement of traditional gender allocations and responsibilities. At the same time, the local authorities, official workers and the mothers adapt the social programmes to recent gender trends. For example, men may carry out some domestic activities single-handedly, take care of children without their wives, women may leave men, and women and men may work together in off-farm activities, with husbands and wives taking joint decisions about domestic issues. In other words, the gender effects of the Familias en Accin programme in rural settings currently move between old gender customs and practices and changeable gender conditions. In Latin-American terms, it is possible to say that these conditions range between 'machismo' and 'feminist liberalization'. Reprinted by permission of Blackwell Publishers"," Quijano, Mara A.

Examining ways in which contact opportunities associated with transfers might help identify vulnerable households and link them with social welfare services: A systematic review of the literature,"This review sets out to examine the published literature, exploring ways in which contact opportunities associated with cash transfers might help to identify vulnerable households and link them with social welfare services. Social welfare is a very broad construct, ranging from formalized social work provision to an array of service-type encounters, which could fall under the wide umbrella of social welfare, legal provision, family support services, child protective services and alternative care. A systematic review of published papers on cash transfer and social welfare generated 146 studies that were hand-sorted according to a series of inclusion criteria. These required availability of data, design competence and presence of a control group, from low/middle-income countries, cash transfers rather than other transfer types, accessible in the published literature in English reporting on developmental transfers as opposed to emergency transfers. Geographic and provision criteria were reached by 37 studies and only 12 of these included empirical data. Nine were evaluation studies, two used secondary analysis of existing data to explore childbearing and one presented a study synthesis. The majority emanated from South America (only one from South Africa). Two of the 12 were non-conditional pensions (Brazil and South Africa). The remainder were conditional transfers. The review showed that there is a lack of clearly identified, well-controlled, systematic studies from which to glean a sound evidence base on social welfare and cash transfer to guide policy. Studies reporting on nutritional status/child growth found positive effects of cash transfers (n = 6). Children benefiting from the programmes were healthier than those who were not enrolled in the programmes. Studies recorded positive effects of cash transfers on migration outcomes, psychological outcomes, preventative health-care participation, some health outcomes and school-related outcomes such as improved attendance, enhanced enrolment, reduced dropout and earlier enrolment Cash transfers improved household consumption and expenditures (more spent on children's clothing, education and food - better quality food) to benefit children of the household. Programmes decreased or had no impact on fertility in Mexico, Nicaragua and Turkey. There were some increases in Honduras, which may or may not be related to the programme. No evaluations of cash transfer schemes reported on direct social welfare provision, legal and protective service access and provision. Grandparent residence and reductions in child labour were associated with cash transfers. In countries where there is a lack of traditional provision in terms of social work, there is a large gap in the provision of social support in general, including cash transfer schemes. The growing literature has shown the need for integration of social welfare into existing provision-be it the location of social welfare in general practice or the combining of government support through non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and community-based projects. The clear message is that stand-alone provision may, in itself, be a barrier to access. Studies should move beyond access to services to explore the implications of service provision for health and welfare gains. This review of studies shows multiple opportunities within existing cash transfer provision for social welfare contacts.

Linking social welfare development with cash transfers and education to promote child wellbeing -- what we know and what we need to know,"This review aimed to identify international literature on the triple provision combination of social welfare services (SWS) embedded within programmes where cash transfers are conditional (CCT) on school attendance in order to inform best policy and practice. The review found only one example of such provision, descriptions of which indicated a benefit of the triple combination approach yet did not provide an in-depth evaluation of the link with SWS. More relevant evidence and indications for future research and policy were found within literature concerned with the double combination: of SWS and schooling, including extended and full-service schools. However, this has to yet been linked to CCT. This literature reports an overall positive impact of a SWS and school integration for both children and families, while noting several complexities and challenges such as resource availability and management issues. Methodologies are currently diverse. A Theory of Change approach may represent an optimum strategy for future programme evaluations to address the complex synergies of inputs and outcomes. Also, the definition of SWS needs to be refined as appropriate to countries of the global South, where the triple combination is of particular relevance.

Responding to vulnerability -- the role of social welfare services and cash transfers,"From a child-focused lens, effective social protection requires an understanding of the sources of vulnerability faced by children, and appropriate responses. One of the useful aspects of the increased prominence of cash transfers in the social protection debate has been to highlight the fact that for many children living in developing countries, economic poverty is a major driver of children's vulnerability and deprivation. However, without taking away from the crucial role of cash transfers, it is also clear that cash alone may not always be the optimum response to children and families' vulnerability. Social welfare services have an important role to play within social protection, but within developing countries this greater role faces two key challenges: weak social welfare services provision and the challenges of incorporating this into the already demanding social protection policy agenda. These challenges point to a number of questions requiring further research and learning.

How relevant is targeting to the success of an antipoverty program?,"Policy-oriented discussions often assume that 'better targeting' implies larger impacts on poverty or more cost-effective interventions for fighting poverty. The literature on the economics of targeting warns against that assumption, but evidence has been scarce and the lessons from the literature have often been ignored by practitioners. This paper shows that standard measures of targeting performance are uninformative or even deceptive about the impacts on poverty, and cost-effectiveness in reducing poverty, of a large cash transfer program in China. The results suggest that in program design and evaluation, it would be better to focus directly on the program's outcomes for poor people than to rely on prevailing measures of targeting.

Effects of Alternative Policies on Income Redistribution: Evidence from Brazil,"Despite recent successes, Brazilian income (cash) transfer policies remain controversial, and alternative approaches to income redistribution are being actively considered. This article contributes to this debate, analysing the effects of several alternative policies for income redistribution in the Brazilian economy using a computable general equilibrium model. Simulations were conducted consistent with the following policies: direct transfer of income, reduction of taxes, and incentives to agricultural exports. The results suggest that transfer of income is the most effective in promoting redistribution of income, with a positive impact on the level of welfare of the poorest households. first submitted December 2008 final revision accepted April 2009.

"Holy alliances: public subsidies, Islamic high schools, and female schooling in Bangladesh","This paper documents the experience of incentive-based reforms in the secondary Islamic/madrasa education sector in Bangladesh within the context of the broader debate over modernization of religious school systems in South Asia. Key features of the reform are changes of the curriculum and policy regarding admission of female students. In return to formal registration and curriculum modernization, madrasas receive financial aid from the government towards teacher salary. Using a cross-sectional census data-set (containing current and retrospective information) on formal secondary schools and madrasas, we first point out that a significant fraction of the existing post-primary registered madrasas today comprises of 'converts'; that is, formerly all-male, unregistered religious schools that previously offered traditional, religious education. Furthermore, these madrasas have embraced female students in recent years following the introduction of yet another incentive scheme, namely a conditional cash transfer scheme for secondary girls. Drawing upon school enrolment data aggregated at the region level, we show that regions that had more (modernized) madrasas were more likely to achieve gender parity in secondary enrolment during 1999-2003, holding the number of secular secondary schools constant. This finding highlights the previously undocumented role played by religious schools in removing gender disparity in rural Bangladesh.

Heads of household programme in Argentina: a human rights-based policy?,"This study analyses the consultative councils (CC) of the Argentinean conditional cash transfer heads of household programme as an institutional innovation directed to put into practice some of the principles of the human rights' approach for eradicating poverty. Since the main responsibilities assigned to the CCs coincided with some of the main principles of the human rights' approach, the research is focused on how CCs responded in practice. Using a case study methodology we show that even when, in theory, the CCs incorporate some of the principles of the human rights' approach to the programme, they deviated from this purpose due to a persistent phenomenon in the social policy arena in developing countries: political clientelism.

Reverse gender gap in schooling in Bangladesh: insights from urban and rural households,"This paper documents a reverse gender gap in secondary schooling outcomes in Bangladesh drawing upon several rounds of nationally representative household survey data. In terms of enrolment status and years of schooling completed, boys are found to lag behind girls in the rural as well as in the urban area. Within the urban sample, the gender gap is widest in the non-metropolitan area. These findings are robust to extensive control for demand and supply-side determinants of schooling and remain unchanged even when we use a within household estimator. We consider one hypothesis, namely gender-differentiated response to a conditional cash transfer program to reconcile the findings of this reverse gender gap.

Heterogeneous Impacts of Conditional Cash Transfers: Evidence from Nicaragua,"In the last decade, the most popular policy tool used to increase human capital in developing countries has been the conditional cash transfer program. A large literature has shown significant mean impacts on schooling, health, and child labor. This paper examines heterogeneous effects using random-assignment data from the Red de Proteccion Social in rural Nicaragua. Using interactions between the targeting criteria and the treatment indicator, estimates suggest that children located in more impoverished localities experienced a larger impact of the program on schooling in 2001, but this finding is reversed in 2002. Estimated quantile treatment effects indicate that there is considerable heterogeneity in the impacts of the program on the distribution of food expenditures, as well as total expenditures. In particular, households at the lower end of the expenditure distribution experienced a smaller increase in expenditures. This study also presents evidence of the rank invariance assumption to help clarify the interpretation of the quantile treatment effect in the development literature context."," Dammert, Ana CCarleton U and IZAAnaAna C DammertDammertCDammert, Ana C",http://search.proquest.com/docview/56979858?accountid=14496," Taxation and Subsidies: Externalities, Redistributive Effects, Environmental Taxes and Subsidies (H23) , Welfare, Well-Being, and Poverty: Government Programs, Provision and Effects of Welfare Programs (I38) , Economic Development: Human Resources, Human Development, Income Distribution, Migration (O15) , Economic Development: Urban, Rural, Regional, and Transportation Analysis, Housing, Infrastructure (O18) , Urban, Rural, Regional, Real Estate, and Transportation Economics: Regional Migration, Regional Labor Markets, Population, Neighborhood Characteristics (R23) , Nicaragua , Latin America and the Caribbean , Developing Countries , Development , Distribution , Health , Human Capital , Policy , Rural , Schooling , Transfers",EconLit,2009

How Regions Differ,"The article correlates the transformation and democratization processes transpiring both the regions of Latin America and Central and Eastern Europe (CEE). The authors examine the differences attributed in these distinct approaches, per the history of the individual region, and the shared problems regarding social welfare and inequality. Then the article analyzes the social contracts and slowing growth spanning from 1980 to 2005; discussing the deep and recurrent economic shocks and severe constraints, the recovery during the 1990s until financial crises hit, and the effect per the current global crisis. From this standpoint the authors study the implications re the economic shocks and the social policies, calling for reform in both of these regions. However, with these restraints in mind, politicians and technocrats began viewing the liberal agenda as a way to reconcile demands for further discipline and to pay closer attention to the needs of previously excluded groups. Then the authors look into how social safety nets, through the influence of history, formed policy legacies and challenges, and emanated into reform agendas to reach the poor and vulnerable. The article also briefly discusses CCTs - conditional cash transfer programs in Latin America and social insurance issues in the CEE, implications regarding the nature of the current financial crisis on the welfare state, and outcome dependent upon the depth of the crisis.

Conditional cash transfers and school dropout rates,"This paper evaluates a United Kingdom pilot study designed to test whether a means-tested conditional cash transfer paid to 16- to 18-year-olds for staying in full-time education is an effective way of reducing the proportion of school dropouts. The transfer's impact is substantial: In the first year, full-time education participation rates increase by around 4.5 percentage points while the proportion receiving two years of education increases by around 6.7 percentage points. Those receiving the full payment have the largest initial increase in participation and some evidence is found suggesting that part of the effect can be explained by liquidity constraints.

Impact of the Uruguayan Conditional Cash Transfer Program,"We analyze the impact of conditional cash payments on school enrollment, child labor and labor supply implemented between 2005 and 2007 to the poorest Uruguayan households. Targeting income discontinuities are not observed around the thresholds to participate in the program and this result invalidates the use of regression discontinuity designs for evaluating causal effects of the intervention. We apply the propensity score matching estimator to account for the endogeneity of program participation.

Incidence and correlates of 'catastrophic' maternal health care expenditure in India,"Using data from the 60th round of the National Sample Survey of India (2004), the study investigates the incidence and correlates of 'catastrophic' maternal expenditure (ME) in India. Data on ME come from 6879 births that took place during 365 days prior to the survey. The study adapts earlier definitions and methods for catastrophic total health care expenditure to measure 'catastrophic' ME as: (i) maternal health care expenditure more than 10% of the annual normative household consumption expenditure (ME-1), and (ii) maternal health care expenditure more than 40% of the annual 'capacity to pay' (ME-2). The 'capacity to pay' was derived by subtracting state-wise poverty-line household expenditure from household consumption expenditure. The average maternal expenditure varied by place of delivery: US$9.5, US$24.7 and US$104.3 for birth at home, in a public facility and in a private facility, respectively. Sixteen per cent of households incurred ME of more than 10% of total household consumption expenditure (ME-1), while 51% households incurred ME of more than 40% of household 'capacity to pay' (ME-2). While incidence of ME-1 increased with income decile, the reverse was observed for ME-2, reflecting higher non-utilization of institutional maternal care and its non-affordability among poorer households. All the households from the poorest decile and 99% from the second poorest decile paid more than 40% of their capacity to pay. Multivariate regression results indicate that antenatal care and delivery care in private facilities increased the chances of ME-1 and ME-2 (P < 0.001). Measuring maternal expenditure against 'capacity to pay' (ME-2) may be better than measuring it as a proportion of overall household expenditure when assessing financial constraints in the use of maternal services. Improving the performance of the public sector, appropriate regulation of and partnership with the private sector, and effective direct cash transfers to pregnant women in the poorest households may increase utilization of maternal services and reduce the financial distress associated with ME.

Labor Informality Bias of a Poverty-Alleviation Program in Argentina,"In 2002, in the midst of a serious macroeconomic crisis, Argentina implemented a large social program (the Programa Jefes de Hogar, PJH) that provides cash transfers to unemployed household heads meeting certain criteria. In practice, the difficulty in monitoring the unemployment requirement for informal (unregistered) workers would imply a disincentive for the program participants to search for a formal job. By applying matching techniques we evaluate the empirical relevance of this prediction during the period of strong economic growth that followed the crisis. We find some evidence on the informality bias of the PJH when the value of the cash transfer was relatively high compared to wages in the formal labor market."," Gasparini, LeonardoNational U La PlataNational U La PlataNational U La PlataLeonardoLeonardo GaspariniGaspariniGasparini, Leonardo , Haimovich, FranciscoFranciscoFrancisco HaimovichHaimovichHaimovich, Francisco , Olivieri, SergioSergioSergio OlivieriOlivieriOlivieri, Sergio",http://search.proquest.com/docview/57002890?accountid=14496," Taxation and Subsidies: Externalities, Redistributive Effects, Environmental Taxes and Subsidies (H23) , National Government Expenditures and Welfare Programs (H53) , Welfare, Well-Being, and Poverty: Government Programs, Provision and Effects of Welfare Programs (I38) , Economic Development: Human Resources, Human Development, Income Distribution, Migration (O15) , Measurement of Economic Growth, Aggregate Productivity, Cross-Country Output Convergence (O47) , Argentina , Latin America and the Caribbean , Economic Growth , Growth , Labor Markets , Poverty , Poverty Alleviation , Transfers , Wage",EconLit,2009
Efficient Delivery of Subsidies to the Poor: Improving the Design of a Cash Transfer Program in Ecuador,"Many governments provide monetary transfers to low-income families. The mechanism through which these subsidies are distributed may contain several inefficiencies that diminish the net-value obtained by the recipients. In this paper, we build and estimate a behavioral dynamic model that allows us to evaluate the efficiency of current and alternative distribution mechanisms. The proposed model is simple and resembles the individual's decision to collect the transfer. To estimate it, we use data from a cash transfer program in Ecuador where recipients incur high transaction costs each time they collect their benefits. Despite its simplicity, our model is able to replicate the observed data remarkably well. We use it to simulate alternative payment mechanisms and show that an adequate design of the delivery of payments can substantially increase the value of cash transfer programs."," Carrillo, Paul EGeorge Washington UFacultad Latinoamericana de Ciencias Sociales, QuitoPaulPaul E CarrilloCarrilloECarrillo, Paul E , Ponce Jarrin, JuanJuanJuan Ponce JarrinPonce JarrinPonce Jarrin, Juan",http://search.proquest.com/docview/56963699?accountid=14496," Taxation and Subsidies: Externalities, Redistributive Effects, Environmental Taxes and Subsidies (H23) , Welfare, Well-Being, and Poverty: Government Programs, Provision and Effects of Welfare Programs (I38) , Economic Development: Human Resources, Human Development, Income Distribution, Migration (O15) , Ecuador , Latin America and the Caribbean , Distribution , Poor , Subsidies , Transfers",EconLit,2009
The Implications of Grandparent Coresidence for Economic Hardship Among Children in Mother-Only Families,"Estimates suggest that more than 6 million children live with at least one grandparent. Despite evidence establishing the growing prevalence of this arrangement, limited research has focused on estimating the implications of coresidence for the economic well-being of grandchildren. Using data from the 2001 panel of the Survey of Income and Program Participation, this article examines levels of financial hardship among a particularly vulnerable group of children -- those living in mother-only families. Findings suggest that children living in mother-only families that include a grandparent are substantially less likely to be living below or near the poverty level, compared with children living in mother-only families without a grandparent present. The financial security of children in these three-generation households is enhanced through significant economic contributions of the grandparents and from household receipt of a wide range of financial resources, including means-tested cash transfers and other income such as Social Security.

Survey of recent developments,"Indonesia has so far suffered a relatively mild impact from the global financial crisis. Its economy grew at 4% in the year to June 2009, displaying a more resilient response than some of its neighbours. Fiscal stimulus measures, deft monetary policy and cash transfers to the poor served to soften the impact of the crisis. Parliamentary elections in April and presidential elections in July provided further economic stimulus. Election-related spending and the stimulus measures helped maintain formal sector employment levels and the proportion of casual employees in the workforce. Like the cash transfers, payments by parliamentary candidates to voters contributed to household incomes, particularly among the poor. This is reflected in widespread declines in poverty observed in 2009. The crisis, the stimulus package, the direct cash transfers and the election campaign spending combined to create a mechanism of income redistribution in favour of the poor. On 20 October Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono and Boediono were inaugurated as president and vice president for 2009-14. They announced key economic targets for 2014, including 7% economic growth, 5-6% unemployment and an 8-10% poverty level. It is crucial that the two leaders tackle important reforms - even politically sensitive ones - that will remove obstacles to faster and more employment-friendly growth. However, the plan for their first 100 days focuses on a series of small, politically non-sensitive reforms designed to demonstrate their commitment to, and create momentum for, wider reform. This strategy is unlikely to create an impression that the government is serious about more substantial and essential reforms. Nor is it likely to generate the economic impact necessary to bring the economy closer to the government's key economic targets. The slow expansion of infrastructure since the 1997-98 crisis is a major obstacle to future high and sustained economic growth. Despite some signs of improvement in recent years, Indonesia's rate of infrastructure investment remains far below pre-crisis levels. Tackling this problem should be a high priority for the government. While pursuing ways to grow faster, Indonesia - one of the world's largest CO2 emitters-needs to respond more vigorously to climate change. The leaders have pledged to place climate change mitigation high on their policy agenda. Yet little has been said about how, as one of the countries most vulnerable to climate change, Indonesia should support her people's adaptation to its effects. The government needs to give high priority to adaptation and promote it at the international level.

We consider a three-period-lived overlapping generations economy in which children are potential workers and then individuals face the trade-off between education and child labor. We show that there exists the optimal tax rate when the government gets aid money to be spent on cash transfer and public education in the incidence of child labor.

Children's Schooling and Work in the Presence of a Conditional Cash Transfer Program in Rural Colombia,"The paper studies the effects of Familias en Accion, a conditional cash transfer program implemented in rural areas in Colombia since 2002, on school enrollment and child labor. Using a difference-in-difference framework, our results show that the program increased school participation of 14-17-year-old children quite substantially, by between 5 and 7 percentage points and had lower effects on the enrollment of younger children, in the region of 1-3 percentage points. The effects on work are largest in the relatively more urbanized parts of rural areas and particularly for younger children, whose participation in domestic work decreased by around 13 percentage points after the program, as compared to a decrease of 10 percentage points for older children in these same areas. The program had no discernible impacts on children's work in more rural areas. Participation in income-generating work remained largely unaffected by the program. We also find evidence of school and work time not being fully substitutable, suggesting that some, but not all, of the increased time at school may be drawn from children's leisure time."," Attanasio, OrazioU College London and Institute for Fiscal Studies, LondonInstitute for Fiscal Studies, LondonColombian Department of National PlanningEconometria Consultores, BogotaU College London and Institute for Fiscal Studies, LondonInstitute for Fiscal Studies, LondonOrazioOrazio AttanasioAttanasioAttanasio, Orazio , Fitzsimons, EmlaEmlaEmla FitzsimonsFitzsimonsFitzsimons, Emla , Gomez, AnaAnaAna GomezGomezGomez, Ana , Gutierrez, Martha IsabelMarthaMartha Isabel GutierrezGutierrezIsabelGutierrez, Martha Isabel , Meghir, CostasCostasCostas MeghirMeghirMeghir, Costas , Mesnard, AliceAliceAlice MesnardMesnardMesnard, Alice",http://search.proquest.com/docview/57021348?accountid=14496," Analysis of Education (I21) , Welfare, Well-Being, and Poverty: Government Programs, Provision and Effects of Welfare Programs (I38) , Fertility, Family Planning, Child Care, Children, Youth (J13) , Economic Development: Human Resources, Human Development, Income Distribution, Migration (O15) , Economic Development: Urban, Rural, Regional, and Transportation Analysis, Housing, Infrastructure (O18) , Urban, Rural, Regional, Real Estate, and Transportation Economics: Regional Migration, Regional Labor Markets, Population, Neighborhood Characteristics (R23) , Colombia , Latin America and the Caribbean , Child , Children , Rural , Schooling , Transfers",EconLit,2010
Earner-carer model at the crossroads: reforms and outcomes of Sweden's family policy in comparative perspective,"Following the 2006 election, the Swedish earner-carer model of family policy seems to have come to an important crossroads, and questions have been raised about the future course of policies. Will the prototypical earner-carer model in Sweden persist? The separate reforms in cash transfers, services, and tax systems in several respects seem to point in contradictory directions, simultaneously introducing new principles of social care. In this article, past and present reforms and potential outcomes of policies are discussed from an institutional and comparative perspective. Reviewing research on outcomes of earner-carer policies for gendered patterns of productive and reproductive work, class-based stratification, child well-being, fertility, and work-family conflict, the article also contributes to the discussion about future challenges for family policy institutions in Sweden and other advanced welfare states.

No Country for Leftists? Clientelist Continuity and the 2006 Vote in the Brazilian Northeast,"Building upon recent studies of the electoral effects of social policy and President Lula da Silva's coattails in the 2006 Brazilian elections, this article explains the performance of leftist and conservative candidates in elections for governor during that cycle in the Northeast region. The study assesses three systemic factors: the conditional cash transfer program, Bolsa Familia, economic growth, and Lula's coattails on support for right-wing incumbents and left-wing oppositions in the states of Bahia, Maranhao, and Ceara. Based on the analysis of an original municipal-level dataset and a survey of partisan elites, the findings underscore the importance of urban-based party building strategies across the three states and patterns of elite alliances specific to each state. Alliances made in the capitals coupled with divided conservative establishments, facilitated leftist victories in the examined states. At the same time, variations in alliance patterns and leftist party development across the three states reveal that conservative clientele networks remain vibrant bases of right-wing support, especially in the interior, and despite either social policy or Lula's coattails.

Do Conditional Cash Transfers Increase Poor Households' Coping Capabilities? Assessing the Effect of Oportunidades in Poor Urban Settings in Mexico,"This paper examines whether Mexico's conditional cash transfer (CCT) program, Oportunidades, has an effect on poor urban households' coping decisions when faced with an idiosyncratic shock. Poor households are often uninsured and thus have limited risk coping capabilities. While evaluations have found the program to have a positive effect on outcomes such as school enrollment and health seeking behavior, they have primarily focused on rural areas and not examined whether the program helps urban households cope with risks. This paper explores the effect of Oportunidades on poor, urban households' risk-coping strategies by using the latest External Urban Household Evaluation Survey (ENCELURB).

Evaluating the Impact of Brazil's Bolsa Familia: Cash Transfer Programs in Comparative Perspective,"This note reviews the targeting performance of Bolsa Familia and its impact on inequality, poverty, consumption, education, health care, and labor force participation. Bolsa Familia has several design and implementation characteristics that distance it from a pure human-capital-based conditional cash transfer model. For that reason, we compare the impact of Bolsa Familia to that of other conditional cash transfer programs in Latin America, such as in Mexico, Colombia, Ecuador, and Chile. We show that, as have other programs, Bolsa Familia has helped reduce inequality and extreme poverty and has improved education outcomes, without having a negative impact on labor force participation. Where the program has failed to have its intended impact, in health and nutrition, supply-side constraints seem to be the principal problem.

Social Policies to the Test of Market Reforms,"This paper analyses the evolution of social policies in Latin America since the 1980's. It discusses the thesis according to which the hegemony of neo-liberalism would have generated a reduction of the state social intervention. A first part points to the extreme diversity of Latin American social policies & the methodological challenges that derive from it. The paper then underlines the main stages of evolution of public expenses aimed at social purposes during the ""neo-liberal"" period. Three fields are more specifically scrutinized: retirement pensions where, paradoxically, the turn from contributory to funded schemes goes along a growing state commitment; health, where the move towards universal coverage, quite effective, goes along a qualitative fractioning; & welfare programs, among them ""targeted"" assistance & conditional cash transfers (whose relevance needs to be put in perspective). The conclusion insists on the trend towards repolitisation of the field of social policies that has been under way for the past ten years, & the stake they represent for the debate on citizenship.

The Impact of Conditional Cash Transfers on Consumption and Investment in Nicaragua,"This article examines the impact of a Nicaraguan conditional cash transfer programme on measures of expenditures and productive investment. Despite clear evidence from a randomised evaluation that the programme increased current expenditures, there is little evidence that it increased agricultural or non-agricultural investment. An estimated marginal propensity to consume out of the transfers of nearly one, combined with no effect of cumulative past transfers on current consumption, corroborate the direct evidence on investment. In contrast to gains made in human capital investment, the potential for long term increases in consumption as a result of other forms of increased investment may be limited.

Conditional Cash Transfers and Agricultural Production: Lessons from the Oportunidades Experience in Mexico,"This paper explores whether cash transfer programmes conditioned on human capital outcomes can influence agricultural production. Programme impact on food consumption from own production, land use, livestock ownership, and agricultural spending are evaluated using first difference and weighted estimators, in which weights are constructed from propensity scores. The programme is found to increase the value and variety of food consumed from own production and to increase land use, livestock ownership and crop spending. Impact estimates are found to differ across land use categories and PROCAMPO participation. Results support the hypothesis that transfers influence agricultural production and impacts are greater for households invested in agriculture.

Linking Promises to Policies: Law and Development in an Unequal Brazil,"The 1988 Brazilian Constitution contains a wide variety of social and economic rights and expressly embraces development as a fundamental goal. For the results to be effective, however, constitutional provisions of this type require permanent implementation and articulation of public policies that, in turn, are intensely mediated by the law. Assuming that the legal dimension of social policies ultimately matters for development, the article seeks to identify and discuss the distributive effects caused by some Brazilian welfare institutions and their legal arrangements. After describing the regressive outcomes produced by the tax and pensions systems and arguing that such effects reinforce Brazilian's historically rooted deep inequality, the article discusses Programa Bolsa Familia, a conditional cash transfer in Brazil, and presents the preliminary findings of an ongoing research project on law and development (the LANDS project).

Is the EITC as Good as an NIT? Conditional Cash Transfers and Tax Incidence,"The EITC is intended to encourage work. But EITC-induced increases in labor supply may drive wages down. I simulate the economic incidence of the EITC. In each scenario that I consider, a large portion of low-income single mothers' EITC payments is captured by employers through reduced wages. Workers who are EITC ineligible also see wage declines. By contrast, a traditional Negative Income Tax (NIT) discourages work, and so induces large transfers from employers to their workers. With my preferred parameters, $1 in EITC spending increases after-tax incomes by $0.73, while $1 spent on the NIT yields $1.39."," Rothstein, JessePrinceton UJesseJesse RothsteinRothsteinRothstein, Jesse",http://search.proquest.com/docview/57011167?accountid=14496," Taxation and Subsidies: Incidence (H22) , Taxation and Subsidies: Externalities, Redistributive Effects, Environmental Taxes and Subsidies (H23) , Personal Income and Other Nonbusiness Taxes and Subsidies, includes inheritance and gift taxes (H24) , Fiscal Policies and Behavior of Economic Agents: Household (H31) , Time Allocation and Labor Supply (J22) , Incidence , Income Tax , Labor Supply , Negative Income Tax , Tax",EconLit,2010
The Impact of a Cash Transfer Program on Cognitive Achievement: The Bono de Desarrollo Humano of Ecuador,"Throughout Latin America, conditional cash transfer (CCT) programs play an important role in social policy. These programs aim to influence the accumulation of human capital, as well as reduce poverty. In terms of educational outcomes, a number of impact evaluation studies have shown that such programs have led to an increase in school enrollment, ensured regular school attendance and led to a reduction in child labor. Theoretically, such cash transfer programs may also be expected to exert a positive impact on students' test scores, but related empirical evidence is scarce. Accordingly, this paper evaluates the impact of a cash transfer program, the Bono de Desarrollo Humano of Ecuador, on students' cognitive achievements. The paper uses a regression discontinuity strategy to identify the impact of the program on second grade cognitive achievement. Regardless of the specification and sample used, we find no impact of the program on test scores, suggesting that attempts at building human capital, as measured by cognitive achievement, require additional and alternative interventions."," Ponce, JuanFlacsoInstitute of Social Studies, Erasmus U RotterdamJuanJuan PoncePoncePonce, Juan , Bedi, Arjun SArjunArjun S BediBediSBedi, Arjun S",http://search.proquest.com/docview/864379624?accountid=14496," National Government Expenditures and Welfare Programs (H53) , Analysis of Education (I21) , Education: Government Policy (I28) , Welfare, Well-Being, and Poverty: Government Programs, Provision and Effects of Welfare Programs (I38) , Ecuador , Latin America and the Caribbean , Policy , Transfers",EconLit,2010
Medium of exchange matters: what's fair for goods is unfair for money,"Organized groups face a fundamental problem of how to distribute resources fairly. We found people view it as less fair to distribute resources equally when the allocated resource invokes the market by being a medium of exchange than when the allocated resource is a good that holds value in use. These differences in fairness can be attributed to being a medium of exchange, and not to other essential properties of money (i.e., being a unit of account or a store of value). These findings suggest that egalitarian outcomes have a greater likelihood of being accepted as fair when the resources being distributed take the form of in-kind goods rather than of cash transfers.

Auctioning or assigning an object: some remarkable VCG mechanisms,"We construct a variant of the Vickrey auction of a single object where the surplus is split in exogenously fixed shares between the seller and the buyers, up to a margin of error vanishingly exponentially as the number of buyers grows. When the object is the common property of the participants, we can similarly construct VCG mechanisms with a vanishingly small cash transfer to the residual claimant. For any integer q , 3_# q _# n , we find the mechanism guaranteeing to each participant a fair share of the q th highest valuation, while minimizing the worst possible ratio of the cash transfer to the efficient surplus. We perform a parallel analysis when the object is undesirable. We compare the cash lost to the largest spread between individual valuations, and obtain the same trade-offs between fairness and the relative loss of surplus.

"Recombinant workfare, across the Americas: Transnationalizing 'fast' social policy","The paper presents a genealogy of the Bloomberg administration's Opportunity NYC program, launched in 2007 as part of New York City's explicitly experimental anti-poverty strategy. Opportunity NYC was modeled on 'conditional cash transfer' programs, currently operating in more than thirty countries across the Global South, drawing direct inspiration from Mexico's widely touted Oportunidades program. This striking case of South-North policy emulation calls attention to some distinctive features of what is characterized here as a transnationalizing 'fast-policy' regime, based on technocratic forms of program evaluation and development, dense expert networks, and orchestrated communities of practice, within which a range of policy intermediaries-particularly those connected with multilateral agencies-are assuming significant new roles. What appears to be a pragmatic form of policy learning in fact operates in the context of narrow ideological parameters, within which there is a concerted technocratic 'push' toward favored solutions.

Social protection for orphans and vulnerable children in Zimbabwe: The case for cash transfers,"The unprecedented number of orphans and vulnerable children in Zimbabwe has created an urgent need to create innovative ways to provide for the social protection of these children. Innovative packages consisting of educational, food and psychosocial support are being implemented by non-governmental organizations. However, as the orphan crisis continues to deepen, more needs to be done and, learning from the experiences of other countries, the option of cash transfers for social protection for orphans and vulnerable children offers an attractive option for Zimbabwe.

Propping through Related Party Transactions,"Based on a sample of Chinese listed firms from 1998 through 2002, this paper documents that listed firms prop up earnings by using abnormal related sales to their controlling owners. Such related sales propping is more prevalent among state-owned firms and in regions with weaker economic institutions. We also find that these abnormal related sales are not entirely accrual-based but can be cash-based as well, and they serve as a substitute rather than complement to accruals management for meeting earnings targets. Since these abnormal related sales can be cash-based, there is significant cash transfer via related lending from listed firms back to controlling owners after the propping. However, no cash transfer via related lending is found to be associated with accruals earnings management."," Jian, MingNanyang Technological UChinese U Hong KongMingMing JianJianJian, Ming , Wong, T JTT J WongWongJWong, T J",http://search.proquest.com/docview/864393783?accountid=14496," Financing Policy, Financial Risk and Risk Management, Capital and Ownership Structure, Value of Firms, Goodwill (G32) , Firm Performance: Size, Diversification, and Scope (L25) , Economic Development: Financial Markets, Saving and Capital Investment, Corporate Finance and Governance (O16) , Socialist Enterprises and Their Transitions (P31) , China , Asia , Earnings , Firm , Firms",EconLit,2010
Social Safety Net Reform in Jamaica Experience of the Programme of Advancement through Health and Education (PATH),"The main focus of the paper is on the Government's Social Safety Net Reform programme, particularly in relation to its principal component, the Programme of Advancement Through Health & Education (PATH), introduced in 2001. The main design features of PATH included institutional changes, such as the merger of existing programmes, amendments in the legislative framework, strengthening of institutional capacity, the use of a scientific targeting mechanism & the introduction of conditional cash transfers to support human capital investment. The paper discusses both the successes (coverage of the poorest, human capital development, for example) & the difficulties (such as the need to expand primary health care capacity & the effect of high transportation cost on school attendance in rural areas) of the programme. The withdrawal of external funding for the programme is a critical challenge to the sustainability of the programme. However, the Government has indicated its commitment in this regard & it is anticipated that with the efficiency gains from the streamlining of the social assistance programmes the required resources will be available.

Assessing the 'orphan effect' in determining development outcomes for children in 11 eastern and southern African countries,"There are more than 45 million orphaned children in sub-Saharan Africa, 11.4 million because of AIDS - representing approximately 80% of all such orphans worldwide. Programming for orphans is therefore a major policy issue. This article uses the latest publicly available Demographic Health Survey data from 11 eastern and southern African countries to provide a snapshot of the distribution and demographic characteristics of orphans, and to test whether orphans have worse outcomes along a series of socioeconomic outcomes. While the analysis is primarily descriptive, multivariate analysis is undertaken to determine whether orphan/non-orphan differences persist after controlling for age, region of residence and household wealth. Results show, among other things, that while orphan prevalence is higher in urban areas, the majority of orphans live in rural areas. Furthermore, while urban orphans appear to be more vulnerable than their urban peers the most vulnerable children in the region are, in fact, living in rural areas. Multivariate regression analysis also revealed that after controlling for other cofounders, orphan status per se is not the most important negative determinant of children's wellbeing. Gender and region of residence are much more important predictors of poor schooling outcomes, and for all outcomes household wealth is the single most important correlate of better outcomes, with the threshold falling typically between the second and third quintiles. While orphanhood is clearly one important dimension of child vulnerability, other factors are not only important but in some cases have a much stronger quantitative association with child development (e.g. household poverty). Overall social policy as well as the targeting of specific interventions should recognize this fact, and approach child development in a holistic and integrated manner; for example combining specific orphan services such as psychosocial support within broader poverty alleviation and social protection programming such as social cash transfers, school bursaries and health service fee waivers.

Disease forecasts and livestock health disclosure: a shepherd's dilemma,"We analyze how to induce sellers to disclose food safety. With repeated interactions and safety correlated over time, cash transfers alone do not ensure disclosure. Perfect, but costly, testing ensures disclosure with a complex lottery that may be difficult to implement in practice. In contrast, even a noisy quality forecast allows the buyer to induce perfect disclosure with a simple pricing scheme. Forecast introduction may benefit or harm sellers. After introduction, sellers may suffer from increases in forecast precision. As an illustration, we cast our model in the context of Rift Valley fever in an East African livestock market.

Why Cash Violates Neutrality,"Egalitarian liberal political philosophers have been at pains to show that there is a nonnegligible ""place"" for liberty within the framework of an egalitarian theory of justice. Thus, many have insisted that, when redistribution is required in order to achieve greater equality, assets should be transferred in the most abstract form possible, ideally through a system of cash transfers. In this article, we argue that this strategy has the potential to generate significant violations of neutrality. The problem arises from the fact that individuals with certain rates of time preference often want to use social institutions as self-binding mechanisms and as a result may exhibit a preference for in-kind benefits or other institutional arrangements that are frequently misclassified as paternalistic. We argue that egalitarians who rely on cash transfers as a way of accommodating the demands of liberty do so at the expense of neutrality."," Heath, JosephU TorontoCarleton UJosephJoseph HeathHeathHeath, Joseph , Panitch, VidaVidaVida PanitchPanitchPanitch, Vida",http://search.proquest.com/docview/814969490?accountid=14496," Equity, Justice, Inequality, and Other Normative Criteria and Measurement (D63) , Taxation and Subsidies: Externalities, Redistributive Effects, Environmental Taxes and Subsidies (H23) , Egalitarian , Equality , Justice , Redistribution",EconLit,2010
Paraguay's Tekopora Programme for Cash Transfers: Debating Targeting Methods for Beneficiaries,"This article analyses alternative targeting methods for Paraguay's conditional cash transfer programme, Tekopora. The major practical choice is currently between a multidimensional quality-of-life index, which has been used since the programme started, and a proxy means test. This note evaluates the relative performance of these two alternatives. The simulations conducted herein suggest that changing the targeting mechanism from the quality-of-life index to proxy means does not offer any gains in either the efficiency or the efficacy of the programme. If the intention of policymakers is to improve efficacy in reaching the poor, then maintaining the current targeting mechanism with a higher cut-off point is the best option. If the intention is to alleviate extreme poverty, the most efficient impact is also given by the quality-of-life index, but with a lower cut-off point. However, a higher threshold may provide a considerable gain in coverage without a substantial increase in leakage."," Ribas, Rafael PerezU ILInternational Policy Centre for Inclusive Growth, UN Development ProgrammeInternational Policy Centre for Inclusive Growth, UN Development ProgrammeRafaelRafael Perez RibasRibasPerezRibas, Rafael Perez , Hirata, Guilherme IssamuGuilhermeGuilherme Issamu HirataHirataIssamuHirata, Guilherme Issamu , Soares, Fabio VerasFabioFabio Veras SoaresSoaresVerasSoares, Fabio Veras",http://search.proquest.com/docview/859282242?accountid=14496," Taxation and Subsidies: Externalities, Redistributive Effects, Environmental Taxes and Subsidies (H23) , General Welfare, Well-Being (I31) , Measurement and Analysis of Poverty (I32) , Welfare, Well-Being, and Poverty: Government Programs, Provision and Effects of Welfare Programs (I38) , Economic Development: Human Resources, Human Development, Income Distribution, Migration (O15) , Paraguay , Latin America and the Caribbean , Poor , Poverty , Quality , Quality of Life , Transfers",EconLit,2010
Matching the Gold Standard: Comparing Experimental and Nonexperimental Evaluation Techniques for a Geographically Targeted Program,"We compare nonexperimental impact estimates based on matching methods with those from a randomized evaluation to determine whether the nonexperimental approach can ""match"" the so-called gold standard. The social experiment we use was carried out to evaluate a geographically targeted conditional cash transfer antipoverty program in Nicaragua. The outcomes we assess include several components of household expenditure and a variety of children's health outcomes, including breast-feeding, vaccinations, and morbidity. We find that using each of the following improves performance of matching for these outcomes: (1) geographically proximate comparison samples, (2) stringent common support requirements, and (3) both geographic- and household-level matching variables. Even for a geographically targeted program, in which the selection is at the geographic, rather than at the individual or household level, and in which it is not possible to find comparison individuals or households in the program locales, matching can perform reasonably well. The results also suggest that the techniques may be more promising for evaluating the more easily measured individual-level binary outcomes than for outcomes that are more difficult to measure, such as expenditure."," Handa, SudhanshuU NCMiddlebury CollegeSudhanshuSudhanshu HandaHandaHanda, Sudhanshu , Maluccio, John AJohnJohn A MaluccioMaluccioAMaluccio, John A",http://search.proquest.com/docview/742794235?accountid=14496," Welfare, Well-Being, and Poverty: Government Programs, Provision and Effects of Welfare Programs (I38) , Microeconomic Analyses of Economic Development (O12) , Economic Development: Human Resources, Human Development, Income Distribution, Migration (O15) , Nicaragua , Latin America and the Caribbean , Anti Poverty , Antipoverty , Health , Transfers",EconLit,2010

Cohen's D effect sizes were calculated for four outcomes: cognitive gains; behavioral change; health gains; and amount of schooling. We find children from different context and countries receive substantial cognitive, behavioral, health and schooling benefits from early childhood interventions. The benefits are sustained over time.

The Effects of Conditional Cash Transfer Programmes on Adult Labour Supply: An Empirical Analysis Using a Time-Series-Cross-Section Sample of Brazilian Municipalities,"In this paper, we estimate the effects of the conditional cash transfer (CCT) programmes in Brazil on the labour supply of adult males and females. We employ the panel of municipalities that are continuously investigated by the Pesquisa Nacional por Amostra de Domicilios (PNAD/IBGE) over the years 2001-2005. The effects of the Brazilian CCT programmes are estimated both on the participation rate and the mean number of hours worked. Since PNAD does not ask directly surveyed families about CCT programme participation, we use an indirect procedure to identify beneficiary families.

Family networks and school enrolment: evidence from a randomized social experiment,"We present evidence on whether and how a household's behavior is influenced by the presence and characteristics of its extended family. Using data from the PROGRESA program in Mexico, we exploit information on the paternal and maternal surnames of heads and spouses in conjunction with the Spanish naming convention to identify the inter- and intra-generational family links of each household to others in the same village. We then exploit the randomized research design of the PROGRESA evaluation data to identify whether the treatment effects of PROGRESA transfers on secondary school enrolment vary according to the characteristics of extended family. We find PROGRESA only raises secondary enrolment among households that are embedded in a family network. Eligible but isolated households do not respond.

Cash Transfers and the Labor Market,"This paper studies the effects of cash transfers to the poor on the labor market. We build a matching model of the labor market with endogenous job destruction in which agents can be in three states: employed, unemployed, or out of the labor force (home production). Workers are heterogenous in their labor market productivity. An idiosyncratic productivity shock arrives at constant instantaneous rate. Depending on this shock, workers might want to leave the labor market and workers out of the labor force might decide to look for a job. We introduce cash transfers to all agents with income below some threshold level. Our analytical results show: (i) the size of cash transfers has a negative effect on the employment rate, but an ambiguous effect on the unemployment rate; and (ii) the coverage of this welfare program has a positive effect on the employment rate, and an ambiguous effect on the unemployment rate. We also provide some numerical simulations."," Cavalcanti, TiagoU CambridgeFederal U CearaTiagoTiago CavalcantiCavalcantiCavalcanti, Tiago , Correa, MarcioMarcioMarcio CorreaCorreaCorrea, Marcio",http://search.proquest.com/docview/755930488?accountid=14496," Employment, Unemployment, Wages, Intergenerational Income Distribution, Aggregate Human Capital (E24) , Taxation and Subsidies: Externalities, Redistributive Effects, Environmental Taxes and Subsidies (H23) , Welfare, Well-Being, and Poverty: Government Programs, Provision and Effects of Welfare Programs (I38) , U.S. , Northern America , Employment , Transfers , Unemployment , Unemployment Rate , Welfare , Welfare Program",EconLit,2010
Using technology to deliver social protection: exploring opportunities and risks,"Providing cash transfers to vulnerable groups reduces vulnerability and chronic poverty; but delivering cash to remote, rural locations can be expensive and insecure. Alternative delivery systems using technology are thus being piloted. This article uses examples from southern Africa to highlight the opportunities and risks involved in using technology to deliver social protection, with particular focus on two schemes in Malawi. It concludes that there is great potential for the use of technology in delivering social protection, especially if employed at a national scale and taking advantage of the full spectrum of uses to ensure cost-efficiency.

Bridging the hunger gap with cash transfers: experiences from Malawi,"Food shortages have become a chronic feature of many sub-Saharan countries, not just because of bad weather but also because of increasing poverty levels. In economies that do not have government social-security programmes, humanitarian relief and safety-net initiatives are imperative to prevent mass starvation.

The global economic crisis and its impact on the indebtedness of the world's poorest countries,"In the 19th and 20th centuries, economic crises drove many developing countries into debt. The paper discusses the impact of the latest global economic crisis on the indebtedness of the world's poorest nations. The author analyzes changes in the inflow of funds to these countries and the efforts of international financial institutions, such as the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund (IMF), to mitigate the problem of indebtedness. Due to the latest crisis, less foreign investment has reached the world's poorest nations over the past year or so, Cwiklinski says, and their export revenues have also decreased. Revenues from tourism and cash transfers from people working and living abroad have remained stable, after a previous period of consistent growth. The decreased inflow of private capital explains why these countries are struggling with widening budget deficits. To facilitate the implementation of the Millennium Development Goals (MDG), international financial institutions are providing support to the poorest countries in the form of new loans. To reconcile these efforts with the World Bank and IMF's Debt Sustainability Framework for Low-Income Countries (DSF), work is under way to change the way in which international financial institutions calculate the level of debt that they consider to be serviceable by these countries. Although preferential loans enable the world's poorest nations to finance some of their development priorities, these countries will have to return these funds sooner or later. Considering that these countries are already heavily indebted, this may compound their financial problems. Further measures to reduce their financial obligations may prove to be unavoidable over the next decade or so. Moreover, the need to repay new loans may make it difficult for low-income countries to carry out those MDGs that are not attained by the expected deadline."," Cwiklinski, KrzysztofKrzysztofKrzysztof CwiklinskiCwiklinskiCwiklinski, Krzysztof",http://search.proquest.com/docview/863897204?accountid=14496," 10648 3941 5889 , 13746 4025 , 3904 , 475 8168 5889 , 476 8168 5889 , 4930 6590 , 13736 6681 1477 4930 6590 , 6172 6772 9030 , 3480 2958 12092 , 6290 3307 , 9962",International Bibliography of the Social Sciences (IBSS),2010
Designing Pension Programs to Strengthen Formal Labor Markets in Developing Countries: The Case of Indonesia,"Pension systems in developed countries, where labor is concentrated in formal production sectors, are likely to differ from those in developing countries, where labor is more concentrated in informal sectors. Governments have few tools for implementing fiscal policies (taxes and subsidies) in respect of firms and labor in informal sectors. This research develops a comprehensive, multi-dimensional approach to setting up pension systems in developing countries in general and Indonesia in particular. The pension system suggested comprises a short-run consumption tax policy to finance a defined-benefit plan to meet the minimum physical needs of the older population; a medium-run labor income tax policy to finance a defined contribution, fully funded savings plan for individuals and a long-run skilled labor-creation plan through university education to allow more individuals to finance their own pension savings, under the fully funded savings plan. The defined-benefit plan serves as a redistribution tool and the defined-contribution plan as a savings tool. The skilled labor-creation plan is a supporting tool to make the pension program sustainable in the long run. An overlapping generation computable general equilibrium model is calibrated for the Indonesian economy, with heterogeneity in households introduced through the inclusion of skilled and unskilled labor. The model is used to analyze the impact of consumption taxes and pension taxes on labor supply, and to calculate the equivalent variation of the distribution of the consumption tax burden across generations and labor groups. For comparison, a consumption tax to finance defined-benefit pension cash transfers of US$ 1, $2 and $3 per person per day is found to impose a lower burden on skilled than on unskilled labor. Introducing a consumption tax to finance a $1 cash transfer creates an incentive for the highest amount of labor (both skilled and unskilled) to work in the formal sector, and to compensate for consumption tax costs through higher income. Increasing the consumption tax to support $2 and $3 cash transfers reduces labor supply to the formal sector, however, with skilled labor supply decreasing more than unskilled in the $2 case and the reverse in the $3 case. My theoretical contributions are that, given the existence of both formal and informal labor and production sectors in an economy, and the latter being dominant: (1) taxation of expenditures is preferred to taxation of income because the former may induce labor to work in the formal sector; and (2) there exists an optimal level of consumption tax that provides incentives for the largest supply of labor, both skilled and unskilled, to the formal sector."," Widjaja, MuliadiU Indonesia and Indonesian National Planning and Development AgencyMuliadiMuliadi WidjajaWidjajaWidjaja, Muliadi",http://search.proquest.com/docview/753927476?accountid=14496," Social Security and Public Pensions (H55) , Human Capital, Skills, Occupational Choice, Labor Productivity (J24) , Retirement, Retirement Policies (J26) , Nonwage Labor Costs and Benefits, Retirement Plans, Private Pensions (J32) , Economic Development: Human Resources, Human Development, Income Distribution, Migration (O15) , Indonesia , Asia , Developing Countries , Distribution , Education , Expenditure , Labor Income , Labor Markets , Labor Supply , Pension , Policy , Population , Redistribution , Subsidies , Unskilled",EconLit,2010

Local Distributional Effects of Government Cash Transfers in Chile,"Despite rapid economic growth and poverty reduction, inequality in Chile has remained high and remarkably constant over the last 20 years, prompting academic and public interest in the subject. Due to data limitations, however, research on inequality in Chile has concentrated on the national and regional levels. The impact of cash subsidies to poor households on local inequality is thus not well understood. Using poverty-mapping methods to asses this impact, we find heterogeneity in the effectiveness of regional and municipal governments in reducing inequality via poverty-reduction transfers, suggesting that alternative targeting regimes may complement current practice in aiding the poor.

Community interventions supporting children affected by HIV in sub-Saharan Africa: A review to derive evidence-based principles for programming,"Approaching 20 years after the first studies drew attention to the issues faced by children and families affected by human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), evaluation data from programs addressing their circumstances remains limited and clustered, especially when considered in relation to the magnitude of donor spending. A review of evaluation evidence was conducted to derive programming principles for interventions supporting HIV-affected children in sub-Saharan Africa, including care and support, cash transfer and HIV-prevention interventions. Methodologies of existing evaluations reflect diverse aims and research questions, and inconsistent geographical and thematic coverage. The quality of evidence was most rigorous for HIV prevention and least rigorous for care and support, and the resulting lessons learned were correspondingly variable. Evidence across the three intervention types supports several practical strategies and cross-cutting principles to guide intervention delivery, including the importance of formative research and locally tailoring interventions; community and child participation; working directly with women; multifaceted targeting strategies; actively addressing stigma; and careful oversight and monitoring of program implementation. Further efforts to build field staff capacity in monitoring and evaluation and to strengthen program management information systems are a necessary investment in building a sound evidence base to improve programs and effect tangible quality of life improvements for children and families.

Social cash transfers to support children and families affected by HIV/AIDS,"In response to the critical need of affected children and families, the compelling evidence for their benefits, and the receptive environment on the part of governments and donors, several local and international organizations are piloting cash transfers programmes as a mechanism to mitigate the impact of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) on affected communities in sub-Saharan Africa. Few programmes, however, are conceptualized or implemented within a broader framework of social protection, socioeconomic development or human rights. This article traces briefly the philosophical underpinnings of social security in Europe, Latin America and southern Africa to illustrate how income transfers, or social grants, can advance development, increase citizenship in evolving democracies and help to realize human rights, especially through the active engagement of communities in the demand for good quality services of benefit to all. Stand-alone cash transfers programmes, motivated to bring relief to destitute families, have immediate benefits for recipients. However, they can be hijacked by local political and community self-interests and encourage perverse household and community adaptations to receive benefits. In contrast, it is possible to design local cash transfer programmes for the benefit of children that speak into and advance the broader developmental and human rights agenda. HIV and AIDS is intertwined with issues of human rights, no less so than in the case of the poorest families affected by the worst epidemics in the world.

Getting in line: Coordinating responses for children affected by HIV and AIDS in sub-Saharan Africa,"Only one in every eight households containing orphans and vulnerable children (OVC) in African countries received any support from an external source (UNICEF, 2008). This is a reflection of how governments, both rich and poor, have ignored obligations ratified in conventions to ensure the social protection of vulnerable children (United Nations, 1989). Consequently, a disproportionate proportion of the financial burden of care of vulnerable children is borne by affected families and communities. It is deplorable that vulnerable children are forced to rely on the charity of income poor relatives and community members (Wilkinson-Maposa et al., 2005; Foster, 2005b). This situation is likely to continue until governments adequately assume their responsibilities. In countries such as Botswana, governments have responded to the crisis of children and AIDS and consequently most households containing vulnerable children now receive external support (UNAIDS et al., 2006). The movement to establish national social protection schemes for vulnerable households is gaining momentum. If cash transfers become established nationally, they may alleviate suffering on a wide scale (JLICA, 2009). In that case, community groups and non-governmental organizations (NGOs) that are currently responsible for implementing responses to support children affected by HIV and AIDS will still be needed to administer psychosocial and other services that are complementary to those provided by these schemes. It is vital that governments develop a central role in coordinating civil society responses and ensure that resources for vulnerable children are used more effectively. But most African governments have limited capacity to coordinate responses and have only recently engaged in this area that involves a few well-resourced international organisations, many local NGOs and innumerable community initiatives. This article reviews the responses of different sectors responding to the impacts of HIV/AIDS on children, and discusses how these may be better funded, coordinated and monitored, utilizing the findings from a study of civil society OVC initiatives and evolving national responses (Foster, 2008).

Interrupting the intergenerational cycle of poverty with the Malawi Social Cash Transfer,"Cash transfer programs throughout the world were designed within a Social Protection framework to alleviate poverty in the short term and to interrupt the long-term intergenerational cycle of poverty. In this study, we examine the potential of the Malawi Social Cash Transfer Scheme (SCTS) to interrupt the intergenerational cycle of poverty in ultra-poor and labor-constrained households in Malawi. Using qualitative data from 16 focus groups with 163 children, we map the voices of children to various dimensions in a framework of intergenerational poverty. The framework identifies financial, material, environmental, human, social, cultural and political capital as important inputs for older generations to transfer to younger ones in order to avoid lifelong poverty. We found that focus-group participants reported dramatic and widespread changes in their lives resulting from the cash transfer in nearly all of the framework's dimensions. Participants reported that the cash allowed them to gain access to goods and materials, including food, healthcare, school supplies, clothing, blankets, housing and livestock. Respondents described changes in their lives, such as providing less labor for the household, allocating more time to schooling, enjoying adequate and high-quality foods, accessing healthcare and purchasing medicine. They also described better mental health, with new hopes and dreams for the future. These changes have the potential to interrupt the intergenerational cycle of poverty. Nevertheless, despite these widespread and positive benefits to children, whether the SCTS will become part of the national policy, and the scheme's long-term sustainability, is still uncertain.

Introducing conditional cash transfers in India a proposal for five CCTs,"This paper makes the case for converting some of the massive subsidies and significant expenditures on directly targeted poverty reduction programmes into conditional cash transfers (CCTs). All the five CCTs it proposes would be primarily targeted at the below poverty line (BPL) population. It also addresses the minimum requirements to ensure that CCTs succeed, and actually reach the poor instead of meeting the fate of usual directly targeted poverty reduction programmes. It also notes the fact that while the identification of the poor has so far proved beset with errors of exclusion and inclusion, those can be mostly resolved through a revised methodology that has already been almost finalised, and will be implemented by 2010."," Mehrotra, SantoshInstitute of Applied Manpower Research, DelhiSantoshSantosh MehrotraMehrotraMehrotra, Santosh",http://search.proquest.com/docview/1285626053?accountid=14496," 2007 1952 12916 , 9963 9962 , 9833 , 2061 7446 , 4387 , 3898 , 175 387 30",International Bibliography of the Social Sciences (IBSS),2010
Anti-poverty Transfers and Spatial Prices in Tunisia,"In this paper, the role of price deflation in estimating the impact of price subsidies and anti-poverty cash transfer schemes on poverty in Tunisia is studied. Three types of price corrections are considered: (a) no corrections; (b) living standards deflated by spatial Laspeyres price indices; and (c) living standards deflated by true price indices that are estimated from a quadratic almost ideal demand system. Distinguishing these corrections and using data from Tunisia, the effects of the price deflation and the demand system estimation on poverty and budget leakage estimates are analyzed. These effects can intervene at two stages of the estimation: (a) the calculation of transfer levels for each household: and (b) the estimation of post-transfer social statistics. Results show that price correction, whatever its form, may have only limited importance for the assessment of anti-poverty policy in Tunisia. Correcting or not for spatial price differences, or for consumption substitution does not modify the performance ranking of the studied policies. This is at odds with other findings in the empirical literature that price differences may be important for poverty monitoring."," Muller, ChristopheU Aix-MarseilleChristopheChristophe MullerMullerMuller, Christophe",http://search.proquest.com/docview/760191787?accountid=14496," Price Level, Inflation, Deflation (E31) , Taxation and Subsidies: Externalities, Redistributive Effects, Environmental Taxes and Subsidies (H23) , Measurement and Analysis of Poverty (I32) , Welfare, Well-Being, and Poverty: Government Programs, Provision and Effects of Welfare Programs (I38) , Economic Development: Human Resources, Human Development, Income Distribution, Migration (O15) , Tunisia , Africa , Anti Poverty , Deflation , Living Standards , Policy , Poverty , Prices , Subsidies , Transfers",EconLit,2010

"Public Finance, Governance, and Cash Transfers in Alleviating Poverty and Inequality in Chile","As the Chilean government seeks to reduce poverty and inequality through cash transfers to poor households, local governments are responsible for both identifying the poor and allocating transfers. Until recently, however, evaluating the effectiveness of local governments in enacting these policies has been restricted by data limitations. This paper builds on recent evidence that cash transfers have highly variable impacts on poverty and inequality at the county level. In particular, we explore how local public finance and the strength of the governing mandate influence the efficiency of cash transfers. With a richly specified model, we find that public spending on goods and services, the fraction of available subsidies claimed by the local government, and the share of county land that is zoned for industrial purposes are all correlated with considerable reductions in poverty and inequality. In addition, the strength of the governing mandate weakly influences the efficiency of transfers in reducing poverty, but not inequality. These results demonstrate that a better understanding of such institutions can lead to more efficient targeting for social programs.

Survey of recent developments,"Sri Mulyani's resignation as finance minister in May disturbed markets and aroused concern about the government's commitment to reform. This concern was partly alleviated by the appointment of two well-respected individuals as finance minister and deputy finance minister. Further progress with reform will depend heavily on this new team and other key officials. Strong presidential support will also be needed to resist attempts by parliament to interfere excessively with the finance ministry's work. The economy continued its steady recovery from the impact of the global financial crisis (GFC), but the recovery could still be jeopardised if sovereign debt concerns in Europe persist and block the rebound in global trade and commodity prices. Inflation continues to accelerate, suggesting little room for complacency on monetary policy. Fiscal policy, on the other hand, remains conservative. The higher deficit in the revised 2010 budget is not excessive, and is unlikely to be realised in any case. The real budget challenge is to spend budgeted amounts fully and well. The new five-year plan is also conservative and does little to clarify spending priorities, including for the president's 'connectivity' agenda. Despite the GFC, poverty continued to decline, thanks largely to the uninterrupted expansion of GDP and to cash transfers to the poor. Unemployment also continued to fall, although particular groups suffered slight increases in unemployment (young workers 15-25 years old) and somewhat larger reductions in working hours (urban, non-poor, and male-headed households). Nevertheless the large and sustained deceleration of manufacturing growth and the closely related dramatic shift of employment from the formal to the informal sector provide cause for concern. Distortionary labour market policies may help to explain both. A new mining law significantly alters the legal environment for firms in this industry, and also introduces long discredited policies intended to 'increase value added' by requiring the domestic processing of minerals. A new law on local government taxes attempts to reduce uncertainty for citizens and investors, but the nature of overall spending by local governments is of much greater importance for the investment climate. The central government has recently been seeking to restore the role of the 'missing intermediate' level of government and to boost the centre's indirect control over local governments through provincial governments and governors.

Qualitative methods for assessing conditional cash-transfer programmes: the case of Panama,"Governments in Latin America and elsewhere have implemented conditional cash-transfer programmes to improve standards of living in populations defined as vulnerable and excluded from the benefits of development, in order to improve access to education and health services, and to improve human capital. Qualitative research conducted among three indigenous groups in Panama provides lessons for assessing these programmes on the basis of the perceptions and culturally informed beliefs and practices of potential beneficiaries. This article shows that required co-responsibilities should be matched with high-quality services that are consistently available and socially, culturally, and linguistically appropriate.

Educational Disparity and the Persistence of the Black-White Wage Gap in the U.S.,"This paper examines the relationship between contemporary racial inequality of schooling and the black-white wage gap in the U.S. In particular I ask: what policies would be effective at reducing the black-white wage gap in the U.S.? In order to address this question, I develop a model of human capital accumulation in which agents differ by race. I calibrate the model to reflect the U.S. system of education financing since the mid-1950s, and find that more than half of the black-white wage gap in the U.S. in the early 1990s can be accounted for by differential human capital accumulation by race. This indicates an increased role for policy in addressing racial inequality in the U.S. The results of the policy experiments conducted in this paper indicate that a conditional cash transfer program and a policy of decreased reliance on local property tax revenue would be effective in reducing the black-white skill and wage gaps."," O'Gorman, MelanieU WinnipegMelanieMelanie O'GormanO'GormanO'Gorman, Melanie",http://search.proquest.com/docview/864379008?accountid=14496," National Government Expenditures and Education (H52) , State and Local Government: Health, Education, Welfare, Public Pensions (H75) , Educational Finance, Financial Aid (I22) , Education: Government Policy (I28) , Economics of Minorities, Races, Indigenous Peoples, and Immigrants, Non-labor Discrimination (J15) , Wage Level and Structure, Wage Differentials (J31) , U.S. , Northern America , Education , Inequality , Policy , Race , Racial , Wage , Wage Gap",EconLit,2010
Cash transfers and high food prices: Explaining outcomes on Ethiopia's Productive Safety Net Programme,"An ongoing and highly politicised debate concerns the relative efficacy of cash transfers versus food aid. This paper aims to shed light on this debate, drawing on new empirical evidence from Ethiopia's Productive Safety Net Programme (PSNP). Our data derive from a two-wave panel survey conducted in 2006 and 2008. Ethiopia has experienced unprecedented rates of inflation since 2007, which have reduced the real purchasing power of PSNP cash payments. Our regression findings confirm that food transfers or 'cash plus food' packages are superior to cash transfers alone - they enable higher levels of income growth, livestock accumulation and self-reported food security. These results raise questions of fundamental importance to global humanitarian response and social protection policy. We draw out some implications for the design of social transfer programmes and describe some steps that could be taken to enable 'predictable transfers to meet predictable needs'.

School exclusion as social exclusion: the practices and effects of a conditional cash transfer programme for the poor in Bangladesh,"Evidence indicates that a much-feted conditional cash transfer programme designed to widen access to basic education in Bangladesh has failed in its aims. The programme is analysed here as an instance of the effort to govern chronic poverty. For the state, education fits within a national project of poverty reduction and creating governable citizens. For the poor, education signals social inclusion and access to the state. Yet class and social distinctions through which state actors 'see' poor children result in beneficiary selection practices that routinely exclude the poorest from school, with longer-term adverse effects for their social inclusion and citizenship.

The Short-Term Impacts of a Schooling Conditional Cash Transfer Program on the Sexual Behavior of Young Women,"Recent evidence suggests that conditional cash transfer (CCT) programs for schooling are effective in raising school enrolment and attendance. However, there is also reason to believe that such programs can affect other outcomes, such as the sexual behavior of their young beneficiaries. Zomba Cash Transfer Program is a randomized ongoing CCT intervention targeting young women in Malawi that provides incentives (in the form of school fees and cash transfers) to current schoolgirls and recent dropouts to stay in or return to school. An average offer of US$ 10/month conditional on satisfactory school attendance--plus direct payment of secondary school fees--led to significant declines in early marriage, teenage pregnancy, and self-reported sexual activity among program beneficiaries after just one year of program implementation. For program beneficiaries who were out of school at baseline, the probability of getting married and becoming pregnant declined by more than 40 and 30%, respectively. In addition, the incidence of the onset of sexual activity was 38% lower among all program beneficiaries than the control group. Overall, these results suggest that CCT programs not only serve as useful tools for improving school attendance but may also reduce sexual activity, teen pregnancy, and early marriage."," Baird, SarahGeorge Washington UU MalawiU CA, San DiegoWorld BankSarahSarah BairdBairdBaird, Sarah , Chirwa, EphraimEphraimEphraim ChirwaChirwaChirwa, Ephraim , McIntosh, CraigCraigCraig McIntoshMcIntoshMcIntosh, Craig , Ozler, BerkBerkBerk OzlerOzlerOzler, Berk",http://search.proquest.com/docview/760191459?accountid=14496," Taxation and Subsidies: Externalities, Redistributive Effects, Environmental Taxes and Subsidies (H23) , Education: Government Policy (I28) , Fertility, Family Planning, Child Care, Children, Youth (J13) , Economics of Gender, Non-labor Discrimination (J16) , Economic Development: Human Resources, Human Development, Income Distribution, Migration (O15) , Malawi , Africa , Pregnancy , Pregnant , Schooling , Women",EconLit,2010
Black sites: locating the family and family law in development,"While the family as an economic institution has traditionally been sidelined in development policy, development institutions like the World Bank now promote a range of legal and policy reforms that touch on the family and the household. This Article considers how interventions designed to expand formal markets and to encourage participation in markets and investments in human capital might provoke change within the family and the household. Although they aim to increase welfare by increasing measurable economic growth, such interventions have both constitutive effects on the household itself and significant effects on the bargaining power of household members both at home and at work, effects that can be illuminated by attention to the legal reforms themselves. Taking as its starting point the family as an economic entity, this Article taxonomizes the wide range of laws that effectively regulates the family and the household, and highlights properties of legal rules, such as their impact on the bargaining power of different social groups, that tend to be ignored or suppressed in regulatory and governance debates in the field of development. Aided by that expanded taxonomy, it investigates the impact on the family and the household of legal and policy initiatives in four areas: gender equality, social protection through conditional cash transfers, labor market formalization, and land titling. Tracing the effects of regulatory interventions across the market/household divide or continuum indicates how such reforms may induce households to adapt in ways that undermine as well as further welfare and equality objectives. But attention to the continual interactions between the household and the market not yet in view within general measurements and analyses of the economy, also indicate how and where they might sometimes undermine economic growth objectives as well."," Rittich, KerryUniversity of TorontoKerryKerry RittichRittichRittich, Kerry",http://search.proquest.com/docview/816381972?accountid=14496," 4770 7253 , 4774 9874 5574 10472 11888 , 11549 4368 9705 , 11923 11949 13521 , 7155 7711 , 7197 8560 9511 4309 , 10691 , 11949 13521 , 3939 , 4368 9705",International Bibliography of the Social Sciences (IBSS),2010
Does Money Matter? The Effects of Cash Transfers on Child Development in Rural Ecuador,"A large body of research indicates that child development is sensitive to early-life environments, so that poor children are at higher risk for poor cognitive and behavioral outcomes. These developmental outcomes are important determinants of success in adulthood. Yet, remarkably little is known about whether poverty-alleviation programs improve children's developmental outcomes. We examine how a government-run cash transfer program for poor mothers in rural Ecuador influenced the development of young children. Random assignment at the parish level is used to identify program effects. Our data include a set of measures of cognitive ability that are not typically included in experimental or quasi-experimental studies of the impact of cash transfers on child well-being, as well as a set of physical health measures that may be related to developmental outcomes. The cash transfer program had positive, although modest, effects on the physical, cognitive, and socioemotional development of the poorest children in our sample."," Paxson, ChristinaPrinceton UInter-American Development BankChristinaChristina PaxsonPaxsonPaxson, Christina , Schady, NorbertNorbertNorbert SchadySchadySchady, Norbert",http://search.proquest.com/docview/814967391?accountid=14496," Taxation and Subsidies: Externalities, Redistributive Effects, Environmental Taxes and Subsidies (H23) , Welfare, Well-Being, and Poverty: Government Programs, Provision and Effects of Welfare Programs (I38) , Fertility, Family Planning, Child Care, Children, Youth (J13) , Economic Development: Human Resources, Human Development, Income Distribution, Migration (O15) , Ecuador , Latin America and the Caribbean , Child , Children , Development , Health , Mothers , Poor , Poverty , Poverty Alleviation , Transfers",EconLit,2010
Dealing with displacement: can ''social protection'' facilitate long-term adaptation to climate change?,"This article explores the possibilities of using social protection to manage and reduce the risks of forced displacement resulting from climate change. It reviews the relevant literature on migration, disasters and climate change, and constructs a model through which international policies may be used to encourage resettlement options that support the capabilities and entitlements of poor and vulnerable populations. By distinguishing between rapid-onset disasters and long-term environmental change, it explores the ways in which cash transfers, asset transfers and conditional cash transfers may be used to break the cycle of vulnerability, destitution and distress migration that can occur during times of severe environmental stress. An important distinction is made between ''economic migration,'' which implies that households have at their disposal an opportunity to engage in forward-looking analysis about the ways in which they will invest household resources and ''distress migration,'' which implies that household decisions about investment and migration are largely ad hoc responses to external environmental processes and events. The article reviews recent discussions about the prospects of revising the international refugee regime, and identifies the opportunities and challenges of using social protection to support household decisions that can facilitate economic migration over the long-term.

Comments on Contingency Management and Conditional Cash Transfers,"This essay discusses research on incentive-based interventions to promote healthy behavior change, contingency management (CM) and conditional cash transfers (CCT). The overarching point of the essay is that CM and CCT are often treated as distinct areas of inquiry when at their core they represent a common approach. Some potential bi-directional benefits of recognizing this commonality are discussed. Distinct intellectual traditions probably account for the separate paths of CM and CCT to date, with the former being rooted in behavioral psychology and the latter in microeconomics. It is concluded that the emerging field of behavioral economics, which is informed by and integrates principles of each of those disciplines, may provide the proper conceptual framework for integrating CM and CCT."," Higgins, Stephen TU VTStephenStephen T HigginsHigginsTHiggins, Stephen T",http://search.proquest.com/docview/814968413?accountid=14496, Health Production (I12),EconLit,2010
Can in-work benefits improve social inclusion in the southern European countries?,"This paper analyses the effects of implementing a family-based and an individual in-work benefit in the southern European countries using EUROMOD, the EU-wide tax-benefit microsimulation model. In-work benefits are means-tested cash transfers given to individuals, through the tax system, conditional on their employment status. They are intended to enhance the incentives to accept work and redistribute resources to low income groups. The family-based in-work benefits seem to be more redistributive, in particular in Italy and Portugal, but the presence of extended families does not enable such policies to be well targeted on the very poorest, especially in Spain. Individual policies lead to better incentives to work than family-based in-work benefits, in particular for Spanish and Italian women in couples whose labour market participation is far below the European average.

Social protection in times of crisis: experiences in Eastern Europe and Central Asia,"The social impacts of the global economic crisis are only slowly beginning to be felt in Eastern Europe and Central Asia. Many countries in the region have tried to protect social spending during the crisis. Some countries have adjusted or expanded the coverage, duration and levels of social benefits. Few countries, however, have made concerted use of employment and social protection policies to mitigate any social impact. This article uses model family analysis to assess existing legal provisions and entitlements for their potential to prevent poverty in families with children. It shows that in many countries family benefit packages have a negative net balance for families with children compared with childless couples. These findings help to explain the persistence of the higher poverty risk faced by families with children across the region. This article argues that the prospect of economic recovery offers an opportunity to reconsider the direction of social protection in the region and to move towards simpler, more integrated and better-resourced cash transfer mechanisms.

"Conditional cash transfers and female schooling: the impact of the female school stipend programme on public school enrolments in Punjab, Pakistan","Instead of mean-tested Conditional Cash Transfer (CCT) programmes, some countries have implemented gender-targeted CCTs to explicitly address intra-household disparities in human capital investments. This study focuses on addressing the direct impact of a female school stipend programme in Punjab, Pakistan - Did the intervention increase female enrolment in public schools? To address this question, we draw upon data from the provincial school censuses 2003 and 2005. We estimate the net growth in female enrolments in grade 6-8 in stipend eligible schools. Impact evaluation analysis, including difference-and-difference (DD), triple differencing (DDD) and regression-discontinuity design (RDD), indicate a modest but statistically significant impact of the intervention. The preferred estimator derived from a combination of DDD and RDD empirical strategies suggests that the average programme impact between 2003 and 2005 was an increase of six female students per school in terms of absolute change and an increase of 9% in female enrolment in terms of relative change. A triangulation effort is also undertaken using two rounds of a nationally representative household survey before and after the intervention. Even though the surveys are not representative at the sub-provincial level, the results corroborate evidence of the impact using school census data.

"Income Shocks and Consumption Smoothing Strategies: An Empirical Investigation of Maize Farmer's Behavior in Kebumen, Central Java, Indonesia","Farmers in most developing countries usually face vulnerability in consumption due to income shocks caused by crop loss, price falls, disaster, sickness, and death and unexpected expenditure. They will respond differently to income shocks depending on their asset ownership, labor endowment, access to loan, family assistance, and family structure. We quantitatively analyze the consumption smoothing strategies of maize farmers' response to income shocks in Kebumen, Central Java-Indonesia. The ordinary least square (OLS) method confirms that selling cattle plays a central role in protecting consumption especially from income shocks such as price falls and crop loss. Farmers that experienced income shocks related to demographic shocks such as sickness and death and experienced expenditure shocks related to custom such as birth, marriage and religious event require large effort by combining strategies to smooth their consumption. In this case, farmers are forced to sell their land even though it is a costly alternative. However, widening access to the loan market helps them maintain their consumption. Unfortunately, the hypothesis that the government policies such as cheap rice, cash transfer and health insurance are effective instrument to smooth consumption is not supported by consistent statistical evidences in all models."," Dartanto, TeguhNagoya U and U IndonesiaU IndonesiaTeguhTeguh DartantoDartantoDartanto, Teguh , NurkholisNurkholis",http://search.proquest.com/docview/925700451?accountid=14496," Microeconomic Analyses of Economic Development (O12) , Economic Development: Agriculture, Natural Resources, Energy, Environment, Other Primary Products (O13) , Micro Analysis of Farm Firms, Farm Households, and Farm Input Markets (Q12) , Indonesia , Asia , Developing Countries , Farmers , Rice",EconLit,2010
Curbing Corruption Through Social Welfare Reform? The Effects of Mexico's Conditional Cash Transfer Program on Good Government,"Conditional cash transfer programs, an innovation in social welfare administration, have received considerable acclaim as a means of enhancing human capital and reducing leakage of public resources through corruption. While numerous studies examine the effects of the program on human capital indicators in Mexico and various other countries that have adopted the approach, little is known about the effects of these programs on levels of corruption and on political life more generally. Using data from Transparency International Mexico, the Federal Register of Civil Society Organizations, and the national census, this paper analyzes whether conditional cash transfers have any bearing on corruption but also on two other aspects of political life argued to affect government probity in the long term: the density of civil society organizations and the empowerment of women as indicated by levels of active involvement in civil society. The conclusions are encouraging with respect to reducing corruption but rather dismal regarding the effects on civil society and the empowerment of women.

Impactos do Programa Bolsa Familia sobre o Trabalho de Criancas e Adolescentes Residentes na Area Urbana em 2006. (With English summary.),"The purpose of this article is to investigate the impacts of the conditional cash transfer program Bolsa Familia on infant and juvenile labor among urban families who benefit from the program. The chosen method is propensity score matching and the data are provenient from the PNAD (Pesquisa Nacional por Amostra de Domicilios--National Sample Household Research) carried out in the year 2006. The results showed that the Bolsa Familia Program has caused an increase in school attendance and a modest reduction in idleness among children, adolescents, boys, and girls. On the other hand, no significant impacts of the program were observed among children, adolescents, boys and girls who only work, or work and study. In summary, the social program increases school attendance, but does not contribute to the battle against infant and juvenile labor."," Araujo, Guilherme SilvaDIEESE, Sao PauloInstitute of Economics, Federal U UberlandiaInstitute of Economics, Federal U UberlandiaGuilhermeGuilherme Silva AraujoAraujoSilvaAraujo, Guilherme Silva , Ribeiro, RosanaRosanaRosana RibeiroRibeiroRibeiro, Rosana , Neder, Henrique DantasHenriqueHenrique Dantas NederNederDantasNeder, Henrique Dantas",http://search.proquest.com/docview/1221126160?accountid=14496," Taxation and Subsidies: Externalities, Redistributive Effects, Environmental Taxes and Subsidies (H23) , Analysis of Education (I21) , Marriage, Marital Dissolution, Family Structure, Domestic Abuse (J12) , Fertility, Family Planning, Child Care, Children, Youth (J13) , Economic Development: Human Resources, Human Development, Income Distribution, Migration (O15) , Brazil , Latin America and the Caribbean , Adolescent , Children , Families , Infants , Juvenile",EconLit,2010
Latin American Women's Protection after Adjustment: A Feminist Critique of Conditional Cash Transfers in Chile and Argentina,"This paper analyses conditional cash transfer (CCT) policies in Argentina and Chile from a gender perspective. Policy advocates maintain that, through the income provided by CCTs, women acquire some economic autonomy and empowerment within the household. This positive analysis is, however, tempered by gender-based concerns about the developmental value of conservative appeals to women as ""mothers"", founded on traditional cultural norms, in regional policy design. Drawing on these two country examples, the objective of the paper is to assess the terms and conditions of women's inclusion as ""conduits of policy"" in CCTs in the Southern Cone. Findings indicate that the continuity of policy in Chile's anti-poverty strategies locates women as being accountable for family well-being within a multidimensional and psychological vision of poverty. Chile constitutes a radical example of the extension of women's individual responsibilities in managing household poverty with no collective component. By contrast, in Argentina the role of women appears to be dictated more by continuous changes in the state's definition of poverty alleviation, rather than the developmental objective of empowering women. Women's positioning in CCTs could be labelled as bearers of politics, in a context that transfers to women the duty of socially assisting others while rendering their personal needs progressively less visible.

The Forgotten Dimension of Social Reproduction: The World Bank and the Poverty Reduction Strategy Paradigm,"This article invokes Gramscian theory in an effort to better grasp the reorganization of social reproduction under neoliberal globalization. It argues that recent transformations in the world development order warrant a rethinking of the concept of social reproduction, towards acknowledging the increasingly apparent role of transnational governance institutions in organizing social reproduction processes, particularly in peripheral countries. To substantiate this argument, the article interrogates the Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper development approach, the most visible policy tool of the post-Washington Consensus. In the Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper process, the World Bank has started to link debt relief administered through the Enhanced Heavily Indebted Poor Country (HIPC II) initiative to the delivery of basic social services to the poor, and directly finances human capital investments through conditional cash transfer programs. While conditionalities attached to Bank funding continue to promote the privatization of various state functions associated with social reproduction, especially in the areas of health care and education, the Bank, at the same time, funds 'social inclusion' programs that directly absorb some of these functions. This signals the emergence of a new social reproduction regime of 'conditional inclusion' under World Bank leadership."," Ruckert, ArneU OttawaArneArne RuckertRuckertRuckert, Arne",http://search.proquest.com/docview/847276356?accountid=14496," International Monetary Arrangements and Institutions (F33) , Taxation and Subsidies: Externalities, Redistributive Effects, Environmental Taxes and Subsidies (H23) , Welfare, Well-Being, and Poverty: Government Programs, Provision and Effects of Welfare Programs (I38) , Economic Development: Human Resources, Human Development, Income Distribution, Migration (O15) , Nicaragua , Latin America and the Caribbean , Development , Education , Globalization , Health , Health Care , Human Capital , Policy , Poor , Poverty , Transfers , Washington Consensus , World Bank",EconLit,2010
Formal-informal economy linkages and unemployment in South Africa,"South Africa's high unemployment and small informal economy has been attributed to barriers to entry in informal labour markets. We develop a general equilibrium model based on a typology of informal activities that captures formal/informal linkages in product and labour markets. Simulations reveal that trade liberalisation increases formal employment, hurts informal producers, and favours informal traders and may explain the dominance of traders instead of producers. Wage subsidies also raise employment but further heighten competition for informal producers. Cash transfers favour informal employment, albeit with a fiscal burden. Results confirm the role of formal/informal linkages and product markets in explaining policy outcomes.

Disability Cash Transfers in the Context of Poverty and Unemployment: The Case of South Africa,"South Africa's Disability Grant (DG) program has been criticized for its poor administration and the dependency culture it promotes. This paper assesses the program's targeting effectiveness and its effects on labor supply. Using disability self-reports and standard measures of economic well being, the results suggest that DG's inclusion errors are relatively limited but exclusion errors are substantial and serious. The paper also shows that increased leniency in disability screening policy in the Gauteng province in the early 2000s does not appear to have altered labor market behaviors relative to Northern Cape, a province where there was no change in policy.

Middle Class Welfare in Australia: How Has the Distribution of Cash Benefits Changed since the 1980s?,"The purpose of this article is to examine trends in 'middle class welfare' in Australia, defined in various ways, including the extent of cash transfers going to working age families with incomes above the second decile in the distribution of family incomes, the middle 50 per cent, and the richest 20 per cent of working age families. We use nationally representative income survey data for selected years between 1982 and 2007-08. We find that while according to this definition there was an increase in 'middle class welfare' between 1982 and 2007-08, this was relatively modest, and was focused on families not far above the second decile. We conclude that difficulties associated with tighter targeting of mean tested payments in an already tightly targeted system would achieve little in terms of increased efficiency and would likely cause considerable pain."," Whiteford, PeterU New South WalesU New South WalesU New South WalesPeterPeter WhitefordWhitefordWhiteford, Peter , Redmond, GerryGerryGerry RedmondRedmondRedmond, Gerry , Adamson, ElizabethElizabethElizabeth AdamsonAdamsonAdamson, Elizabeth",http://search.proquest.com/docview/919217824?accountid=14496," Personal Income, Wealth, and Their Distributions (D31) , National Government Expenditures and Welfare Programs (H53) , Welfare, Well-Being, and Poverty: Government Programs, Provision and Effects of Welfare Programs (I38) , Australia , Oceania , Distribution , Income , Transfers , Welfare",EconLit,2011
The Basic Income Road to Reforming Iran's Price Subsidies,"Iran has become the first country in the world to provide a de facto basic income to all its citizens. This article reviews the development of the main component of Iran's economic reform plan--the replacement of fuel and food subsidies with direct cash transfers to the population--and shows how a system of universal, regular, and unconditional cash transfers emerged almost by default as a by-product of an attempt to transform an inefficient and unfair system of price subsidies. The main features of the cash subsidy system are compared with those of a basic income; then some lessons from this experience are drawn that may enhance the prospects of basic income as a realistic proposition."," Tabatabai, HamidUnlistedHamidHamid TabatabaiTabatabaiTabatabai, Hamid",http://search.proquest.com/docview/913434420?accountid=14496," National Government Expenditures and Welfare Programs (H53) , Welfare, Well-Being, and Poverty: Government Programs, Provision and Effects of Welfare Programs (I38) , Iran , Asia , Subsidies , Transfers",EconLit,2011

The re-organization of family care in an international migration context,"ABSTRACT IN SPANISH: El cavejeciminto de la poblacin, los cambios en los deseos socioprofesionales de las mujeres y la p_rdida de rules sociales que apoyen los cuidados familiares han desafiado la labor de la proteccin social y han evidenciado nuevas frmulas de atencin personal en los hogares. La aprobacin de un marco estatal de regulacin de la dependencia y la proliferacin de transferencias econmicas han sido las respuestas institucionales para la provision de cuidados de larga duracin. La contratacin de una empleada de hogar como cuidadora ha sido la alternativa seguida por las familias, en algunos casos, animadas por el auge de estos subsidios monetarios. Ello la supuesto un cambio en el r_gimen de cuidados espaol, donde la reorganizacin de los cuidados no pasa por una divisin sexual y generacional ms equilibrada en las tareas asistenciales, sino en la mercantilizacin de estos trabajos. La aceleracin de llegadas de poblacin inmigrante, feminizada y en situacin irregular, ha propiciado que este sector de cuidados dentro del servicio dom_stico, se convierta en un nicho laboral para las personas extranjeras. El artculo explora las conexiones existentes entre la naturaleza de la proteccin social y la mercantilizacin de la asistencia, comparando las estrategias de provisin de cuidados de personas mayores en cada una de las comunidades autnomas segn la implicacin del estado, el modelo migratorio y la incorporacin laboral femenina. // ABSTRACT IN ENGLISH: This paper presents the link between the characteristics of the social protection system and the commodification of care. In order to show this, care supply strategies for the elderly are analysed in the Autonomous Regions in Spain according to the implication of the state social policy, the migratory model and the incorporation of the female native population into the labour market. The ageing of the population, the changes in the socio-labour expectations of native women and the loss of social networks supporting family care have challenged the role of the social protection system and have shown new ways of personal care within households. The government's responses for the provision of long term care have been based on the passing of the regulation of dependence within the framework of the Spanish state policy and the spread of cash transfers. The hiring of a female domestic worker as a care provider has been the alternative followed by families, in certain cases encouraged by the rise in these economic benefits. This fact has changed the Spanish care system where the re-organization of care does not imply a more balanced sexual and generational division of care tasks, but in the commodification of this work. The sharp increase in feminized and irregular immigrant population has favoured that the care sector in the framework of domestic work becomes a relevant labour niche for foreigners."," Martnez Bujn, RaquelUniversity of A CoruaRaquelRaquel Martnez BujnMartnez BujnMartnez Bujn, Raquel",http://search.proquest.com/docview/1038902176?accountid=14496," 2027 654 , 11888 10472 , 8040 , 13598 5421 6091 , 4748 , 3434 3517 3513 , 2546 7805 3198 1077 , 397 396 129",International Bibliography of the Social Sciences (IBSS),2011
Impact of Public and Private Cash Transfers on Poverty and Inequality: Evidence from Vietnam,"This article investigates the extent to which public and private transfers affected poverty and inequality in Vietnam in the mid-2000s. It finds that the impact of public transfers on poverty was negligible, due to the low coverage of the poor and the relatively small amounts transferred. Moreover, the effect of the receipt of transfers on expenditures was small: recipients decreased the labour supply and only a limited amount of the extra income went to current consumption. Domestic private transfers were somewhat more successful in reducing poverty. With most public and private transfers going to non-poor households, inequality was only marginally affected.

The impact of conditional cash transfers on marriage and divorce,"The present study provides the first piece of evidence on the short-run impacts of a conditional cash transfer program on marital transitions among low-income households. Data from the experimental evaluation of the PRO-GRESA program in Mexico is used to provide new evidence on the effects of targeted transfers on marital dissolution and the formation of new unions. The PROGRESA program, one of the first large-scale conditional cash transfer programs in existence, established by the Mexican government in 1997, provides transfers to poor households in rural (as well as urban) areas. The transfers are paid to women contingent on certain requirements, children's school attendance and family-level visits to health services being prominent among them. The program initially involved an evaluation component: 506 communities were selected to participate in a randomized evaluation. Communities were randomly assigned into two groups-the treatment group being phased in to the program in March-April 1998 and the control group in November-December 1999. Using detailed survey data for all community members collected throughout the 1997-99 evaluation period allows us to clearly estimate the short-term program impacts on marital transitions.

The impact of the Social Cash Transfer Scheme on food security in Malawi,"The Malawi Social Cash Transfer Scheme (SCTS) was launched in 2006 to improve food security by directly providing cash transfers to the country's most destitute households. Although government-implemented cash transfer schemes have gained popularity throughout Latin America, these schemes are just emerging in Africa. While where there is evidence of the beneficial impact of cash transfers on food security from Latin American countries, there is a dearth of evidence from resource poor countries in Africa. In order to fill this gap, we conducted a longitudinal, randomized community control study of the pilot SCTS in Mchinji, Malawi from March 2007 to April 2008. In this study, we describe the impact of approximately US$14 per month on food security among recipient households compared to control households using indicators of food consumption and expenditures and dietary diversity. We present compelling evidence, whereby each of the tested outcomes yields large effect sizes that are highly statistically significant, demonstrating a sizeable impact of cash transfers on food security and food diversity in rural Malawi. The SCTS appears to be an effective tool within the National Social Welfare Policy for improving food security in the country's destitute households. Research highlights: Transfers allowed households to increase food expenditures and improve dietary diversity. Cash recipients smoothed food consumption and reduced hunger during the rainy season. A variety of food is available in local markets. Transfers link poor households to markets. Transfers increase both the likelihood of having and the quantity of food stores. Policymakers are optimistic about the cash transfer, but the sustainability of the SCTS is unclear.

The Difficult Articulation between Universal Policies and Targeted Programs: Institutional Ethnography of the Bolsa Familia Program in Brazil,"One of the unresolved debates about social policy is the relationship between universal and targeted programs. In this context, conditional cash transfer program Bolsa Familia, in Brazil, has an institutional design that allows us to think this discussion in a different way because it generates innovations to transcend the limitations of focused programs. How -- ever, many of these innovations do not work in practice because of difficulties of coordination between the program and the universal welfare policy, which is organized in a National System of Social Assistance. Using institutional ethnography and an organizational approach, which defines the government as a net of dual organizations concluded that the articulation difficulties are due to the type of relationship established between two organizational forced to live under one command, but have different internal logics on key issues for the integration of both approaches. This causes limitations in the potentialities and results of the program, and in the real possibility of joint targeted and universal policies.

The diffusion of Conditional Cash Transfer programs in the Americas,"In the mid-1990s, Brazil and Mexico created innovative social policies known as Conditional Cash Transfers (CCTs). Since then, CCTs have spread to countries throughout Latin America and beyond. While these programs reflect a new development norm, their spread is surprising given that some emulating countries lack the basic education and health infrastructure to support increased demand from beneficiaries. This article draws on a policy diffusion framework to explain the spread of CCTs. The author contrasts domestic preconditions (political ideology, state capacity and human development levels) with international pressure (neighborhood effects, professional norm-creation and financial inducements by international financial institutions) to explain the diffusion of CCTs. In order to elucidate the mechanisms that drive diffusion processes, the article draws on mixed methods to uncover learning and emulation among actors.

"Actors and ideas behind CCTs in Chile, Costa Rica and El Salvador","Conditional Cash Transfer programs are currently at a crossroads, between consolidating minimum safety nets and laying the basis for universal social policy. In assessing which direction CCTs will take, it is important to analyze their formation. What domestic actors have been influential and how have expert-driven international ideas entered the domestic policy process? Is the impact related to existing welfare regimes? In this article the authors show that in general CCTs are the product of top-down and closed policy formation by elite coalitions, in which international factors play a central role. Nevertheless, domestic factors associated with welfare regimes, in particular the difference between state and non-state, informal regimes, account for important cross-national variations. If CCTs are to become a stepping-stone to universal social policy, closed policy communities have to be opened up.

The authors consider the political and economic dimensions in their evaluation of Bolsa Familia's contribution to the reduction of poverty and inequality.

Learning effect of a conditional cash transfer programme on poor rural women's selection of delivery care in Mexico,"Background The Mexican programme Oportunidades/Progresa conditionally transfers money to beneficiary families. Over the past 10 years, poor rural women have been obliged to attend antenatal care (ANC) visits and reproductive health talks. We propose that the length of time in the programme influences women's preferences, thus increasing their use not only of services directly linked to the cash transfers, but also of other services, such as clinic-based delivery, whose utilization is not obligatory. Objective To analyse the long-term effect of Oportunidades on women's use of antenatal and delivery care. Methodology 5051 women aged between 15 and 49 years old with at least one child aged less than 24 months living in rural localities were analysed. Multilevel probit and logit models were used to analyse ANC visits and physician/nurse attended delivery, respectively. Models were adjusted with individual and socio-economic variables and the locality's exposure time to Oportunidades. Findings On average women living in localities with longer exposure to Oportunidades report 2.1% more ANC visits than women living in localities with less exposure. Young women aged 15-19 and 20-24 years and living in localities with longer exposure to Oportunidades (since 1998) have 88% and 41% greater likelihood of choosing a physician/nurse vs. traditional midwife for childbirth, respectively. Women of indigenous origin are 68.9% less likely to choose a physician/nurse for delivery care than non-indigenous women. Conclusions An increase in the average number of ANC visits has been achieved among Oportunidades beneficiaries. An indirect effect is the increased selection of a physician/nurse for delivery care among young women living in localities with greater exposure time to Oportunidades. Disadvantaged women in Mexico (indigenous women) continue to have less access to skilled delivery care. Developing countries must develop strategies to increase access and use of skilled obstetric care for marginalized women.

Welfare residualism: a comparative study of the Basic Livelihood Security systems in China and South Korea,"In this article, the Basic Livelihood Security (BLS) systems of China and South Korea are compared. The purpose of BLS is to provide a safety net for poor families, particularly the unemployed and the retired who were hard-hit by recent economic reforms and crises. A common characteristic of the two systems is residual welfare marked by strict eligibility rules and limited coverage. Both systems are subordinate to the primary goal of economic growth and therefore only compensate for the very disadvantaged left behind by market competition. Neither system is particularly effective in achieving its original antipoverty goals. However, South Korea's provision of self-support programs to supplement cash transfers has helped individuals to move from welfare to work, and thus has implications for China's BLS system. Both countries need to put more emphasis on equity and social justice in their ongoing reforms and expansions of BLS.

Social policy and poverty: an introduction,"This Guest Editorial introduces the context and main themes around which this collection of articles on social policy and poverty is framed. Against the backdrop of calls for accelerated progress towards achievement of the Millennium Development Goals in a context of multiple crises, the role of social policy for social development and poverty reduction is highlighted. Three key themes are addressed by the five contributions in the collection: (1) the role of social protection, in particular cash transfers, in poverty reduction; (2) the importance of labour markets and labour market policies for poverty reduction; and (3) the financing of welfare policies. The guest editors conclude that social protection policies should be grounded in values of social justice and human rights, which calls for strong state commitment towards universal programmes. They further point to the need of institutionalising long-term social policies that benefit from broad-based political support and are grounded in sustainable financing mechanisms.

"Cash transfers, social protection and poverty reduction","Cash transfers form an important and growing part of social protection programming in many developing countries. This article evaluates the use of different types of cash transfers in different regional contexts as a tool for reducing poverty and inequality in developing countries. Particular attention is paid to knowledge about the appropriateness and cost-effectiveness of targeted versus universal cash transfers and about conditional versus unconditional transfers. The article finds that a fine balance is required. On the one hand, overambitious procedures for targeting or conditionality should be avoided where administrative capacity is low. On the other hand, to rule out any possibility of conditionality or targeting on the grounds of weak administrative capacity leaves only the option of universal transfers.

The right to education of Roma children in Romania: European policies and Romanian practices,"After a long history of living in Europe, latterly in democracies governed with reference to human, and children's rights, Roma children still have a very low education status and very low school participation rates. The aims of this article are to review the current state of participation of Roma children in education in European countries, with a special focus on Romania, and to discuss some issues about how the right to education is, or is not, respected in the region. Data accumulated in the last decade are revisited and educational policies are analyzed. Particular attention is given to issues of segregation in education, scrutinized through the lens of Romanian and international education practices. The article recommends a number of policy responses, including the value of added cash transfers, as well as action as action to ensure quality standards in all education settings frequented by Roma children.

A healthier start: the effect of conditional cash transfers on neonatal and infant mortality in rural Mexico,"Conditional cash transfer programs seek to break the intergenerational transmission of poverty by building the human capital of poor children. Despite their popularity throughout the developing world, relatively little is known about their effect on children's health outcomes. This paper evaluates the impact of the Mexican conditional cash transfer program, Progresa, on two important health outcomes: infant and neonatal mortality. It exploits the phasing-in of Progresa over time throughout rural Mexico to identify the impact of the program. The paper shows that Progresa led to a large 17% decline in rural infant mortality among the treated, but did not reduce neonatal mortality on average. The benefit-cost ratio is between 1.3 and 3.6. Tests for heterogeneity show larger declines for some groups including those municipalities whose pre-program levels of mortality were above the median, and those that prior to the program had higher illiteracy rates, and less access to electricity.

More than just money: Patterns of disaggregated welfare expenditure in the enlarged Europe,"This article demonstrates the potential of the disaggregated expenditure approach in comparative welfare state analysis by applying it for comparing patterns of welfare spending across 28 European countries. An initial factor analysis shows that welfare states differ primarily along their emphasis either on cash transfers for the elderly or on social services and cash transfers for the working-age population. European welfare states cluster along these two spending dimensions in a way that to a great extent coincides with the well-known delineation of welfare regimes based on institutional characteristics. Furthermore, the results attest to the emergence of a variety of welfare arrangements in the post-communist region, yet with a general orientation toward a Bismarckian or conservative model. The results of this analysis demonstrate that disaggregated welfare expenditure measures retain considerable importance in elucidating the realities of contemporary welfare policy.

Do conditional cash transfers for schooling generate lasting benefits? A five-year followup of PROGRESA/Oportunidades,"Conditional cash transfer (CCT) programs link public transfers to human capital investment in hopes of alleviating current poverty and reducing its intergenerational transmission. However, little is known about their long-term impacts. This paper evaluates longer-run impacts on schooling and work of the best-known CCT program, Mexico's PROGRESA/Oportunidades, using experimental and nonexperimental estimators based on groups with different program exposure. The results show positive impacts on schooling, reductions in work for younger youth (consistent with postponing labor force entry), increases in work for older girls, and shifts from agricultural to nonagricultural employment. The evidence suggests schooling effects are robust with time.

Policies for the Poor: Verifying the Information Base,"This paper illustrates how policy formulation without prior data verification would not make much sense and serve any purpose. Given the National Sample Survey (NSS) finding on substantial errors of inclusion of the non-poor in the targeted Public Distribution System (PDS) and its extenuation that all the targeted beneficiaries are genuinely poor, we examine how valid is the explanation and hence, the recommendation for a universal PDS. Contrary to the general perception, the targeted PDS is universal and the need of the hour is to address the error of excluding the genuinely poor rather than provide a universal PDS/cash transfer."," Suryanarayana, M HIndira Gandhi Institute of Development Research, MumbaiMM H SuryanarayanaSuryanarayanaHSuryanarayana, M H",http://search.proquest.com/docview/1667946145?accountid=14496," Methodology for Collecting, Estimating, and Organizing Microeconomic Data, Data Access (C81) , Taxation and Subsidies: Externalities, Redistributive Effects, Environmental Taxes and Subsidies (H23) , Measurement and Analysis of Poverty (I32) , Welfare, Well-Being, and Poverty: Government Programs, Provision and Effects of Welfare Programs (I38) , Economic Development: Human Resources, Human Development, Income Distribution, Migration (O15) , India , Asia , Distribution , Policy , Poor , Transfers",EconLit,2011
Social Policy And Vote In Brazil: Bolsa Familia and the Shifts in Lula's Electoral Base,"The electoral implications of conditional cash-transfer programs have been widely debated in recent years. In the particular case of Brazil, analysts have argued that the social policies that President Lula da Silva's first government implemented enabled the Workers' Party to broaden its electoral clientele from middle-class and highly educated voters to low-income and poorly educated individuals from the Northeast. The conditional cash-transfer program known as Bolsa Familia (BF) is said to have played a key role in this shift of electoral support and to have worked as a powerful clientelistic tool for Lula. Using survey data, this article challenges this view by showing that, despite changes in the profile of Lula's supporters, the BF program cannot account for them. Poor voters vote differently across regions; BF recipients were already Lula voters in 2002 and cast ballots for him during his reelection at the same rate as nonrecipients.

Decentralization and targeting of social spending in Brazilian municipalities,"The intense process of decentralization of some social policies observed in Brazil since the 1980s has not given rise to the diminution of the regional inequalities in terms of those policies' attention to local necessities. On the other hand, in the past years, the success of the Bolsa Familia conditional cash-transfer program-with centralized management and focused attention on the most impoverished-has fostered the interest on evaluating what provision strategy is able to offer the most efficient results in terms of the cost-necessity relationship. The examination of the social policies based on two central dimensions (centralization-decentralization and universalized-focused) has revealed that centralization and focused coverage present better results than decentralization and universalized coverage.

Governing Health Risk by Buying Behaviour,"This article considers the role of conditional cash transfers as a mechanism of governing health risk by buying behaviour change in sexual practice. Conditional cash transfers have come to be identified as a potential solution to the problem of HIV prevention, and as such look likely to be applied throughout countries with high prevalence rates in sub-Saharan Africa. The article considers the implications of two pilot studies in Tanzania and Malawi for governing the risk of HIV infection. It outlines the problem of behaviour change and individual rationality, the potential of conditional cash transfers as a relatively inexpensive programme with high outcomes, and some of the limitations and implications of these initiatives for individual bodies, rationality and global health governance. The article makes the argument that conditional cash transfers should be met with caution and that governing health risk by buying behaviour represents the intersection of bio-political control with neo-liberal forms of economic incentive through financial gain. The balancing of long-term health needs with short-term financial gain induces will to change behaviour, the problem being the sustainability of such change in the absence of financial gain and the long-term consequences of constructing behaviour.

"Neoliberalism, the semi-clientelism and political theory of scale in Mexican anti-poverty measures","This article examines the implications of the multi-scalar politics of Mexican anti-poverty policies for the long-term process of democratization. The federal anti-poverty policy, Progresa / Oportunidades, was designed to eliminate traditional clientelistic practices. While more obvious practices of pork-barrel politics have been eliminated in poverty alleviation programs, continued practices of top-down processes of program design and implementation strategies have resulted in the emergence of semi-clientelism. This paper argues that municipal and state political actors have responded to these federal policies in ways that may or may not promote deeper levels of democracy, and which have led to the reconstitution of semi-clientelism. The paper draws upon recent revisionist approaches to political clientelism, and introduces a mutli-scalar approach borrowed from political geography. Based on this theoretical approach, the article examines the role of state and municipal authorities in the delivery of federal anti-poverty benefits within the Oportunidades conditional cash transfer program.

Cash Transfers and Economic Growth: A Mixed Methods Analysis of Transfer Recipients and Business Owners in Malawi,"Social protection policies that simultaneously reduce poverty and stimulate economic growth and development will be transformational for direct recipients and disadvantaged communities. This study assessed whether the Malawi Cash Transfer stimulates economic growth in the communities where it is operational. Data collection was conducted in Mchinji Malawi from 2007-2009. This study is based on data from two sources including 1) a randomized community control trial designed to measure the impact of the cash transfer and 2) qualitative interviews with business owners. Over the course of one year, the cash transfer intervention group had increased demand for and increased expenditures on foods, basic necessities, livestock, healthcare, and schooling supplies versus the comparison group whose expenditures remained low throughout the study. Additionally, cash transfer households invested in productive assets and farming equipment, which led to greater agricultural production, consumption, and sales. The majority of business-owner respondents confirmed that transfer recipients are frequent customers and reported that sales to transfer recipients were an important part of their business. Respondents reported that the transfer strengthened local markets by providing a steady source of customers and cash, with reliable sales even during the rainy season. Business owners grew their businesses, earned additional profits and some made investments in infrastructure and capital. This study yields insights into the mechanisms by which cash transfers impact economic growth and contributes to the discourse on social protection strategies. Once the cash transfer scheme is operational throughout Malawi, it appears as though there will be important impacts for recipients, non-recipients and local businesses. Findings from this study may be applicable throughout resource-poor countries in Africa. Still, continued follow up and larger studies are needed to determine the consistency and scale of impacts on economic growth and development."," Miller, Candace MBoston UCandaceCandace M MillerMillerMMiller, Candace M",http://search.proquest.com/docview/913435417?accountid=14496," National Government Expenditures and Welfare Programs (H53) , Measurement and Analysis of Poverty (I32) , Welfare, Well-Being, and Poverty: Government Programs, Provision and Effects of Welfare Programs (I38) , Fiscal and Monetary Policy in Development (O23) , Malawi , Africa , Development , Expenditure , Poor , Transfers",EconLit,2011

Microfinance: An Alternative Tool for Alleviating Roma Poverty in the Marginalized Regions,"There is a gap in the microfinance literature on microsavings as a form of microfinance; and their impact on clients, microenterprises, households, communities, and financial institutions. Microfinance arises as a new tool in developing as well as developed countries. It is widely known since the 1970's and often connected with the name of Nobel Peace Prize laureate Muhammad Yunus. The aim of the paper is to analyze effects of microsavings programs on well-being of poor households participating in microsavings program in Eastern Slovakia. According to the results active and successful clients perceive positive change in level of their household management and they perceive their ability to manage household better than unsuccessful clients. Furthermore, active and successful clients perceive positive subjective change in quality of living and they perceive higher level of overall quality of living than unsuccessful clients. Based on a sample of 112 households from three towns (Ostrovany, Stara L'ubovna and Moldava nad Bodvou) subjective perception and objective change in well-being of households are assessed and it is argued that the programs have positive effects on poverty and contribute to poverty alleviation.

Migration and child development during the food price crisis in El Salvador,"Migration is often used as parts of both ex post and ex ante strategies to mitigate risks to household incomes. There is little empirical evidence, however, of the way that migration actually helps households in times of shocks. In this paper, I describe how the peak of the worldwide food price crisis affected anthropometric statistics among young children in El Salvador, and how households with access to international migrants were not affected as negatively as households without such access. In 2008, El Salvador experienced food price inflation of 15%, and the evaluation of Red Solidaria, El Salvador's conditional cash transfer program, shows that height-for-age (HAZ) Z scores among children under 3years old declined by 0.2 standard deviations on average. In this paper, I use the Red Solidaria evaluation data to assess whether children in households with access to remittances or international migrants were better off than households without access to migration income. Using both repeated cross-sectional data and individual panel data, I find that as theory would expect, children in households with access to international migrants have much lower declines in their HAZ scores.

A step in the wrong direction: linking the South Africa Child Support Grant to school attendance,"Placing conditionalities on cash transfers imposes costs on those seeking the benefit, and on the implementing institutions. A small, unconditional but means-tested regular cash transfer - the Child Support Grant (CSG) - for young South African children in households living in poverty was introduced in 1998. A new regulation requires that beneficiaries attending school have to show proof of regular attendance twice a year. Education is highly valued in South Africa, and school attendance is not a priority problem. The quality of education for children from households in poverty is, however, dismal. Unnecessary additional administrative burdens will now be imposed. All the evidence points strongly against the new policy.

The impact of cash transfers on household welfare in Namibia,"Namibia has a long history of providing a universal and non-contributory old age pension, child grants using means testing and quasi-conditionalities, and other cash transfers. Multivariate analysis presented in this paper confirms that these transfers play an important role in alleviating poverty, especially for the very poor. The poverty-reducing effects of the child grants are likely to increase further as access is being rapidly expanded. However, the impact in terms of reducing Namibia's extremely high inequality is limited. The targeting of the cash transfers towards the poorest groups takes place through two main channels. For the child grant, targeting occurs as a result of the orphan status eligibility criteria, as orphans are over-represented in lower-income households. For the universal social pension, it appears that some of the relatively less poor do not receive it even if they are eligible. Means testing of child grants appears ineffective, even without considering administrative costs.

Improving the Measurement of Poverty,"This study estimates 2007 national poverty rates using an approach largely conceptualized by a 1995 National Academy of Sciences panel and similar to the supplemental poverty measure that will soon be produced by the U.S. Census Bureau. The study uses poverty thresholds based on expenditures for shelter, food, clothing, and utilities as well as a measure of family income that includes earnings, cash transfers, near-cash benefits, tax credits, and tax payments. The measure also accounts for child care, work, and out-of-pocket medical expenses; variation in regional cost of living; and mortgage-free homeownership. Under this method, the rate of poverty is estimated to be higher than the rate calculated in the traditional manner, rising from 12.4 percent in the official measure to 16 percent in the new measure; the rate of child poverty is more than 3 percentage points higher, and elderly poverty is nearly 7 points higher."," Hutto, NathanColumbia UColumbia UColumbia UColumbia UNathanNathan HuttoHuttoHutto, Nathan , Waldfogel, JaneJaneJane WaldfogelWaldfogelWaldfogel, Jane , Kaushal, NeerajNeerajNeeraj KaushalKaushalKaushal, Neeraj , Garfinkel, IrwinIrwinIrwin GarfinkelGarfinkelGarfinkel, Irwin",http://search.proquest.com/docview/869564532?accountid=14496," Data Collection and Data Estimation Methodology, Computer Programs: General (C80) , Measurement and Analysis of Poverty (I32) , Fertility, Family Planning, Child Care, Children, Youth (J13) , U.S. , Northern America , Census , Child",EconLit,2011

Based on an exploratory study carried out through a review of pertinent literature, this paper aims to contribute to the advancement of this discussion so as then to discuss the difficulties of the 'emancipation programs' for those benefiting from the Brazilian government's Bolsa Familia Conditional Cash Transfer programs, given the natural fragility of such enterprises and the fact that most of the beneficiaries of the programs do not possess the minimum requirements to become entrepreneurs."," Pereira Morais, LeandroPontifical Catholic U CampinasState U CampinasLeandroLeandro Pereira MoraisPereira MoraisPereira Morais, Leandro , Bacic, Miguel JuanMiguelMiguel Juan BacicBacicJuanBacic, Miguel Juan",http://search.proquest.com/docview/896012092?accountid=14496," Entrepreneurship (L26) , Enterprise Policy (L53) , Economic Development: Financial Markets, Saving and Capital Investment, Corporate Finance and Governance (O16) , Brazil , Latin America and the Caribbean",EconLit,2011
The Effect of Early Interventions in Health and Nutrition on On-Time School Enrollment: Evidence from the Oportunidades Program in Rural Mexico,"This article assesses whether early intervention to improve children's health and nutrition increases the probability of enrolling in primary school on time. Using experimental data from the Mexican conditional cash transfer (CCT) program, Oportunidades, a cross-sectional double-difference estimator on observations from two age cohorts of children is used to identify the impact of early intervention. The results indicate that early health and nutrition interventions can have a positive impact on the timing of enrollment and that caregiver characteristics affect the magnitude of the impact. Early intervention also appears to decrease days of school missed. Overall the results indicate that the full impact of CCT programs on education cannot be measured in the short run as benefits of early health and nutrition interventions may be also felt in the distant future."," Todd, Jessica EUSDAAmerica UJessicaJessica E ToddToddETodd, Jessica E , Winters, PaulPaulPaul WintersWintersWinters, Paul",http://search.proquest.com/docview/869561090?accountid=14496," Health Production (I12) , Health: Government Policy, Regulation, Public Health (I18) , Analysis of Education (I21) , Economic Development: Human Resources, Human Development, Income Distribution, Migration (O15) , Mexico , Latin America and the Caribbean , Education , Health , Nutrition",EconLit,2011

Favourable changes in economic well-being and self-rated health among the elderly,"Adverse economic shocks exert an influence on health perceptions, but little is known about the effect of sudden positive changes in a person's financial situation on self-rated health, particularly among low income people. This paper explores the association between an increase in the amount of non-contribution pensions, public cash transfers given to Costa Rican elderly of low socio-economic status (SES) and changes in self-rated health over time. The analysis is based on data from CRELES, the ''Costa Rican Study on Longevity and Healthy Aging'', which is based on a probabilistic sample of people born in 1945 or earlier, and living in Costa Rica by 2002. The fieldwork for the first and second waves of CRELES was conducted from 2004 to 2006, and from 2006 to 2008, respectively. The Costa Rican Government raised the amount of the non-contribution pension for the poor 100% before July 2007, and an additional 100% after that date. Due to the CRELES fieldwork schedule, the data have a natural quasi-experimental design, given that approximately half of CRELES respondents were interviewed before July 2007, independently of their status in receiving the public cash transfers. Using random effects ordered probit regression models, we find that people who experienced such increase report a greater improvement in self-rated health between waves than those who experienced a smaller increase and than the rest of the interviewees. Results suggest that increases in income may lead to a greater improvement in self-rated health.

"Resource Rents, Redistribution, and Halving Global Poverty: The Resource Dividend","This paper considers the proposal that each country distributes its resource rents directly to citizens as a universal and unconditional cash transfer, or Resource Dividend, and estimates its potential impact on global poverty for the years 2000-06. Using a global dataset on resource rents and the distribution of income, I find that if every developing country implemented the policy then the number of people living below $l-a-day would be cut by between 27% and 66%, depending on the year and the assumptions made. Looking ahead, poverty could be better than halved as long as commodity prices do not drop below their 2004 level.

Non-income effects of welfare receipt on early childhood cognitive scores,"Child poverty in America has become an enduring part of the social landscape that many families must navigate. As prior research has established that income transfers can affect child outcomes, we focus our attention on the conditions under which these transfers occur. Using panel data from the Fragile Families and Child Wellbeing Study, we examine the non-income effects of TANF participation on children's early cognitive development using methods to address statistical concerns about endogeneity and selection. Our results indicate that participating in TANF is negatively associated with cognitive development. Furthermore, we are able to identify maternal stress as a viable causal pathway between TANF receipt and cognitive development, a result that we are unable to replicate with a falsification test involving the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC). Our results suggest that the structure of cash transfers may have effects on early childhood outcomes.

Building orphan competent communities: experiences from a community-based capital cash transfer initiative in Kenya,"As a result of the increasing number of orphans in sub-Saharan Africa, numerous programmes have been initiated to facilitate the care and support of orphaned and vulnerable children. This paper reports on a community-based capital cash transfer initiative in Kenya and explores its role in building orphan competent and supportive communities through its participatory project cycle. Using a mixture of individual and group interviews, 300 orphaned children and 110 adults involved in this initiative were interviewed using open-ended questions. A thematic analysis of the data revealed that many of the communities participating in this programme had become more united and active in the support of orphaned children following the mobilization of much needed economic, political and social support resources. Despite many difficulties, largely due to the complexity of communities, we conclude that community-based capital cash transfer initiatives can facilitate the building of orphan competent communities.

Extortion in the laboratory,"Abstract: In a laboratory experiment, we study a finitely repeated game (T=15) under complete information. In each round, P demands tribute (cash transfer) from A, A complies or refuses, and after refusals P may punish A. In equilibrium (payoff maximization), P does not punish and A refuses any positive demand. In the experiment, P punishes increasingly often and increasingly severely as she gains experience; most As comply with P's demands. The observations are compatible with linear spite. In a finite mixture model, the types of P and A in the subject pool are characterized. An A that is resistant to extortion (declines all demands) is very rare, and hence the threat of punishment in general is effective, but all As either ignore actual punishment or react negatively to it. They accept to pay tribute but they are resistant to piecemeal expropriation.

Effect of Ecuador's cash transfer program (Bono de Desarrollo Humano) on child development in infants and toddlers: A randomized effectiveness trial,"We examined the effects of Ecuador's Bono de Desarrollo Humano (BDH) an unconditional cash transfer program that was rolled-out using a randomized design on health and development outcomes in very young children. Communities that were randomly assigned to the treatment group began receiving the BDH in 2004 and those randomly assigned to the comparison group began receiving benefits two years later. Families enrolled in the BDH received a monthly cash stipend ($15USD) representing an approximate 610% increase in household income. Participants analyzed in this study are children aged 12 -- 35 months from treatment (n = 797) and comparison (n = 399) communities in rural and urban Ecuador. Main outcomes measured were language skills (the Fundacion MacArthur Inventorio del Desarollo de Habilidades Comunicativas Breve), height-for-age z-score, and hemoglobin concentration. Results indicate that in rural areas, being randomized to receive the BDH in very early childhood led to significantly better performance on the number of words a child was saying, and on the probability that the child was combining two or more words. There were no significant effects on language development for children in urban areas and there were no effects on height-for-age z-score or hemoglobin concentration in rural or urban areas. A limited number of potential pathways with respect to cognitive/language stimulation, health behaviors, and parenting quality were also explored. Findings indicate that compared to children in comparison areas, rural children in treatment areas were more likely to have received vitamin A or iron supplementation and have been bought a toy in the past six months. This study provides evidence for significant benefits of an unconditional cash transfer program for language development in very young children in rural areas.

Social Safety Net Programmes in Bangladesh: A Review,"The major social safety net programmes (SSNPs) in Bangladesh can be divided under four broad categories: (i) employment generation programmes; (ii) programmes to cope with natural disasters and other shocks; (iii) incentives provided to parents for their children's education; and (iv) incentives provided to families to improve their health status. The SSNPs can also be grouped into two types depending on whether these involve cash transfers or food transfers. The review indicates that SSNPs in Bangladesh have led to increased school enrolment and attendance especially among girls in secondary schools and closing the gender gap; additional employment generation; provision of food during crisis; building infrastructure; and increased access to and utilisation of maternal health care services. Such programmes deserve high priority to ensure the rights and entitlements of the disadvantaged groups, including the urban poor and the poor living in rural areas. The policy implications of the lessons learned indicate the need to sustain high-level political commitment, strengthen programme management, better targeting of beneficiaries, minimise leakages, improve financial management and payment systems, and strengthen monitoring and supervision."," Khuda, Barkat-eU DhakaBarkat-eBarkat-e KhudaKhudaKhuda, Barkat-e",http://search.proquest.com/docview/963631339?accountid=14496," Taxation and Subsidies: Externalities, Redistributive Effects, Environmental Taxes and Subsidies (H23) , National Government Expenditures and Health (H51) , National Government Expenditures and Education (H52) , National Government Expenditures and Welfare Programs (H53) , Welfare, Well-Being, and Poverty: Government Programs, Provision and Effects of Welfare Programs (I38) , Economic Development: Human Resources, Human Development, Income Distribution, Migration (O15) , Bangladesh , Asia , Education , Entitlements , Health , Health Care , Policy , Poor , Safety Net , School , Transfers",EconLit,2011
Public Spending and Taxation with Non-cooperative Families,"We develop a political economy model of income taxation and public spending, in which we pay special attention to the composition of the latter. The significant economic unit is taken to be the household. Each household is made of two agents, positively sorted by wage, who engage in the non-cooperative home production of a household public good. This leads to an inefficient laissez-faire equilibrium. We consider three policy instruments, a tax rate on labour income, and two types of transfer to the household (cash versus in-kind). The in-kind transfer is one of the inputs in the home production process. Since the pre-intervention equilibrium is inefficient, there is a general consensus among the agents that some corrective taxation is needed; however, those at bottom of the income distribution, who prefer a redistributive (as opposed to corrective) policy, favour a combination of high taxes and cash transfers, while those at the top would rather have low taxes and in-kind provision. Assuming, as seems plausible according to the empirical evidence, that political participation and income are positively correlated, we find that the decisive agent, i.e. the one whose preferred policy wins at the political equilibrium, has income above the mean."," Anderberg, DanRoyal Holloway, U London and CESifo, MunichU Pisa and CESifo, MunichDanDan AnderbergAnderbergAnderberg, Dan , Balestrino, AlessandroAlessandroAlessandro BalestrinoBalestrinoBalestrino, Alessandro",http://search.proquest.com/docview/886911398?accountid=14496," Household Production and Intrahousehold Allocation (D13) , Political Processes: Rent-seeking, Lobbying, Elections, Legislatures, and Voting Behavior (D72) , Taxation and Subsidies: Efficiency, Optimal Taxation (H21) , Fiscal Policies and Behavior of Economic Agents: Household (H31) , Equilibrium , Households , Political , Tax , Taxation , Taxes",EconLit,2011
Combating the menace of food insecurity: the experience of West Bengal,"The Indian government is implementing a package of food-based safety-net programmes to resist disastrous food insecurity. Crucial programmes are (1) the Targeted Public Distribution Scheme, (2) the wage-employment programme (direct cash transfer as wages), and (3) a number of direct nutrition programmes for feeding children. This article explores the implementation of these programmes at district levels in the state of West Bengal, and in particular the extremely disadvantaged district of Purulia. West Bengal was selected for study because it has a decentralised governance structure and the distinctive mark of uninterrupted governance by the Left Parties under the leadership of the Communist Party of India (Marxist) since 1977. Data presented, supported by related field evidence, show a mixed record of combating hunger in West Bengal relative to other states. In a number of respects, but not all, progress has been made over time. Overall, the democratic structure of the panchayats in West Bengal enables the free flow of information, which helps the government to avert mishap.

Understanding use of health services in conditional cash transfer programs: Insights from qualitative research in Latin America and Turkey,"Conditional cash transfer programs provide cash grants to poor households conditional on their participation in primary health care services. While significant impacts have been demonstrated quantitatively, little attention is paid to why CCTs have these observed impacts, and as importantly -- why impacts are not greater than they are. This article draws on qualitative research from four countries over a ten year period (1999-2009) to provide insights into why expected health and nutrition impacts do and do not occur. In Nicaragua, El Salvador, and Turkey, ethnographic methods were used, involving between 87 and 120 households per country, and in Mexico, focus groups were conducted with 230 people. Key informant interviews were conducted with health care providers in all countries. While CCTs operate primarily on the assumption that a cash incentive will produce behaviour change, we found multiple sociocultural and structural influences on health care decisions that compete with cash. These include beliefs around traditional and modern biomedical practices, sociocultural norms, gender relations, and the quotidian experience of poverty in many dimensions. We conclude that impacts can be increased through a better understanding of multiple contextual influences on health care decisions, and greater attention to the health education components and complementary interventions.

Government Transfers and Political Support,"This paper estimates the impact of a large anti-poverty cash transfer program, the Uruguayan PANES, on political support for the government that implemented it. Using the discontinuity in program assignment based on a pretreatment eligibility score, we find that beneficiary households are 11 to 13 percentage points more likely to favor the current government relative to the previous government. Political support effects persist after the program ends.

"The other crisis: the economics and financing of maternal, newborn and child health in Asia","The Global Financial Crisis (GFC) of 2008/2009 was the largest economic slowdown since the Great Depression. It undermined the growth and development prospects of developing countries. Several recent studies estimate the impact of economic shocks on the poor and vulnerable, especially women and children. Infant and child mortality rates are still likely to continue to decline, but at lower rates than would have been the case in the absence of the GFC. Asia faces special challenges. Despite having been the fastest growing region in the world for decades, and even before the current crisis, this region accounted for nearly 34% of global deaths of children under 5, more than 40% of maternal deaths and 60% of newborn deaths. Global development goals cannot be achieved without much faster and deeper progress in Asia. Current health financing systems in much of Asia are not well placed to respond to the needs of women and their children, or the recent global financial and economic slowdown. Public expenditure is often already too low, and high levels of out-of-pocket health expenditure are an independent cause of inequity and impoverishment for women and their children. The GFC highlights the need for reforms that will improve health outcomes for the poor, protect the vulnerable from financial distress, improve public expenditure patterns and resource allocation decisions, and so strengthen health systems. This paper aims to highlight the most recent assessments of how economic shocks, including the GFC, affect the poor in developing countries, especially vulnerable women and children in Asia. It concludes that conditional cash transfers, increasing taxation on tobacco and increasing the level, and quality, of public expenditure through well-designed investment programmes are particularly relevant in the context of an economic shock. That is because these initiatives simultaneously improve health outcomes for the poor and vulnerable, protect them from further financial distress, improve public financing and/or provide a much-needed counter-cyclical stimulus at times of economic slowdown.

"On Cash Transfers, In-Kind Provision, and the Size of Local Jurisdictions","This article analyzes the relationship between the mix of cash transfers and in-kind goods provided by local governments and the local population size and individual preferences. On theoretical grounds, the traditional theory of fiscal federalism and recent contributions on both the local jurisdictions and the breaking up of nations assume that (subcentral) governments provide a single public good, ignoring expenditure composition. However, central and local governments provide both cash and in-kind goods. We propose a simple theoretical model assuming that local governments provide a composite good, formed by money transfers and in-kind services, and that preferences vary across population due to different individual income levels. Normative and positive outcomes are derived and compared assuming a centrally determined expenditure ceiling. Measures designed to move the actual policy mix closer to the optimal one are envisaged. A scenario characterized by a fully decentralized two-step decision process is also analyzed.

Understanding Poverty among the Elderly in India: Implications for Social Pension Policy,"Since 1995, cash transfers to the poor elderly or 'social pensions' have been one of the most important anti-poverty programmes in India. On the assumption that elderly poverty rates are higher than the general population, the minimum eligibility condition is set for 60 + in most states. Our analysis using 52nd and 60th round household-level National Sample Survey data, however, suggests that households with targeted elderly members 60 + do not necessarily have higher poverty rates than non-elderly households. Further analysis suggests that there is an expenditure-mortality link so that the poor tend to die younger and are therefore under-represented among those aged 60 + in most states.

Our analysis using 52nd and 60th round household-level National Sample Survey data, however, suggests that households with targeted elderly members 60 + do not necessarily have higher poverty rates than non-elderly households. Further analysis suggests that there is an expenditure-mortality link so that the poor tend to die younger and are therefore under-represented among those aged 60 + in most states.

A comparative analysis of microfinance and conditional cash transfers in Latin America,"This paper addresses the question of whether microfinance and conditional cash transfers can be effective in alleviating poverty in the Latin American region, and provides a comprehensive assessment of each of these programmes using data and evaluation reports from 19 countries in the Latin American region, analysed in the context of six operational and impact criteria. The research shows that microfinance may be better suited for those living on US$2 per day or higher, while conditional cash transfers may be more beneficial for those living in extreme poverty. Neither programme offers a 'magic bullet' solution for poverty eradication, but they can provide positive outcomes when prescribed in combination.

CASH TRANSFERS AND POVERTY REDUCTION IN CHILE,"The headcount ratio in Chile has declined from 40 percent to 14 percent since 1987. However, most analysis of this reduction uses national and regional poverty statistics. In contrast, we employ poverty mapping methodologies to find heterogeneity in the effectiveness of transfers across counties. To better understand this variation, we explore the roles of characteristics of the local population, structural features of the county, and geography. The greatest reductions in poverty occur in rural households, yet population characteristics and geography are also important. These findings suggest that targeting at low levels of aggregation can deliver further reductions in poverty.

The Ticket to Easy Street? The Financial Consequences of Winning the Lottery,"This paper examines whether giving large cash transfers to financially distressed people causes them to avoid bankruptcy. A comparison of Florida Lottery winners who randomly received $50,000 to $150,000 to small winners indicates that such transfers only postpone bankruptcy rather than prevent it, a result inconsistent with the negative shock model of bankruptcy. Furthermore, the large winners who subsequently filed for bankruptcy had similar net assets and unsecured debt as small winners. Thus, our findings suggest that skepticism regarding the long-term impact of cash transfers may be warranted."," Hankins, ScottU KYU PittsburghVanderbilt UScottScott HankinsHankinsHankins, Scott , Hoekstra, MarkMarkMark HoekstraHoekstraHoekstra, Mark , Skiba, Paige MartaPaigePaige Marta SkibaSkibaMartaSkiba, Paige Marta",http://search.proquest.com/docview/896013716?accountid=14496," Household Saving, Personal Finance (D14) , U.S. , Northern America , Bankruptcy",EconLit,2011
The nutrition transition in Amazonia: rapid economic change and its impact on growth and development in Ribeirinhos,"The goal of this longitudinal study was to assess the impact of economic change and increased market integration on subsistence strategies, living conditions, growth, and nutritional status of Ribeirinhos living in the rural Amazon, Brazil. Data on weight, height, skinfolds, and circumferences, as well as data on economic strategies and living conditions were collected from 469 individuals in 2002 and 429 in 2009. Of these, 204 individuals were measured on both occasions. Independent and paired t-tests were used to identify changes in nutritional status over time in the larger sample and smaller, longitudinal subsample, respectively. Multiple linear regressions were used to examine the relationship between changes in economic/living conditions and nutritional status in the longitudinal subsample. Results indicate modest improvements in linear growth (HAZ) and among male children the observed increase was related to enrollment in the Brazilian conditional cash transfer program, Bolsa Famlia (P = 0.03). In terms of short-term measures of nutritional status, we found a significant increase in ZTSF and a reduction in ZUMA in most age/sex groups. Among subadults, there was a negative relationship between ZUMA and access to electricity (P = 0.01) and positive relationship between ZUMA and the sale of the aa fruit (P = 0.04). Significant changes in weight and BMI (P < 0.01) were found among adult females and both were negatively related to household cash income (P = 0.02 and P = 0.03, respectively). Despite significant changes in economic strategies and lifestyle, changes in nutritional status were modest which may be explained by increased food insecurity documented during this early stage of transition.

"Cash transfers, children and the crisis: protecting current and future investments","In a mix of responses to the food, fuel and financial crises of 2008-9, some developing countries have introduced new safety-net programmes, while others have modified and/or expanded existing ones. Many have introduced conditional cash transfers (CCTs) in recent years, and these have been used as an important starting point for a response. This article aims to describe these various experiences with CCTs, to distil lessons about their effectiveness as crisis-response programmes for households with children, to identify design features that can facilitate their ability to respond to transient poverty shocks, and to assess how they can complement other safety-net programmes.

Towards a unified scheme for environmental and social protection: learning from PES and CCT experiences in developing countries,"Environmental protection and poverty alleviation in the developing world are usually heralded as joint objectives. However, these two goals are often associated with different sectoral policy instruments. While so-called payments for environmental services (PES) are increasingly being promoted for environmental protection, poverty alleviation is increasingly addressed by conditional cash transfers (CCT) program. These instruments although aimed to achieve distinct objectives have a number of similarities and challenges in their design and implementation phases. This paper elaborates on these similarities and develops a unifying generic framework that is used to discuss the extent to which both approaches could be unified.

Oportunidades to Reduce Overweight and Obesity in Mexico?,"This paper investigates the causal effect of Oportunidades, a conditional cash-transfer program in Mexico, on overweight and obesity of adolescents living in poor rural areas. Affecting youth weight was not a goal of this program. However, health economics research suggests that the provision of schooling, health information sessions, and sizable cash transfers to Oportunidades participants could have substantially changed their overweight and obesity rates. Exploiting an exogenous jump in program participation by means of a fuzzy regression discontinuity (RD) design, the evidence of this paper suggests that Oportunidades decreased obesity among participant women. The identified local average treatment effect (LATE) at the threshold for program eligibility suggests that female obesity would decrease if the program was expanded to cover slightly better-off households. The design of the program does not allow disentangling the causal pathways that contributed to the lower prevalence of obesity among women, but the effect likely resulted from increased access to information and schooling, improved dietary quality, increased monitoring of health outcomes and (possibly) increased physical activity. Suggestive evidence shows that teen pregnancy rates were higher among non-participants. Therefore, weight gain after childbirth might also explain higher obesity rates among non-participant females."," Andalon, MabelU MelbourneMabelMabel AndalonAndalonAndalon, Mabel",http://search.proquest.com/docview/901301315?accountid=14496," Health Production (I12) , Health: Government Policy, Regulation, Public Health (I18) , Welfare, Well-Being, and Poverty: Government Programs, Provision and Effects of Welfare Programs (I38) , Mexico , Latin America and the Caribbean , Health , Obesity , Transfers",EconLit,2011
Does more cash in conditional cash transfer programs always lead to larger impacts on school attendance?,"There is considerable evidence that conditional cash transfer (CCT) programs can have large impacts on school enrollment, including in very poor countries. However, little is known about what features of program design account for the observed outcomes. In this paper we analyze the impact of a program in Cambodia that made payments of varying magnitude to otherwise comparable households. The identification is based on a sharp regression discontinuity design. We find that a modest cash transfer, equivalent to approximately 2% of the consumption of the median recipient household, had a substantial impact on school attendance, approximately 25 percentage points. A somewhat larger transfer did not raise attendance rates above this level.

Social Work and Conditional Cash Transfers in Latin America,"Conditional cash transfer (CCT) programs are a recent anti-poverty strategy in Latin America. CCT programs provide cash benefits to finance basic needs and foster investment in human capital to extremely poor households. These benefits are conditioned on certain behaviors, usually related to investments in nutrition, health, and education. In the literature, there is a recognizable lack of analyses from social science disciplines related to CCT program implications. This paper contributes in this arena by analyzing the particular role of social work in CCT anti-poverty programs. The educational element of these programs and its theoretical foundation based on the human capital model, the debate around issues of conditionality and targeting, the possible role of CCT programs in a broader reform of social protection systems, and professional practice implications using the Chilean CCT program as a model will be addressed.

Pension Transfers and Farm Household Technical Efficiency: Evidence from South Africa,"This article analyzes the effect of entitlements from the Old Age Pension Program of South Africa on household technical efficiency using a sample of farm households in South Africa's KwaZulu-Natal province. The analysis is at the household level, and off-farm activities are considered as additional outputs in a nonparametric estimation of technical efficiency. This approach captures the jointness between farm and off-farm activities. The pension's effect is identified by exploiting the age-eligibility criteria in the pension program. Results show a positive effect of the pension and suggest that this large cash transfer can improve households' ability to make use of the best available technologies."," Lovo, StefaniaU SussexStefaniaStefania LovoLovoLovo, Stefania",http://search.proquest.com/docview/913433923?accountid=14496," Production, Cost, Capital, Capital, Total Factor, and Multifactor Productivity, Capacity (D24) , Economic Development: Agriculture, Natural Resources, Energy, Environment, Other Primary Products (O13) , Micro Analysis of Farm Firms, Farm Households, and Farm Input Markets (Q12) , Agricultural R&D, Agricultural Technology, Biofuels, Agricultural Extension Services (Q16) , South Africa , Africa , Farm Household , Farms",EconLit,2011
"Does money matter for mental health? Evidence from the Child Support Grants in Johannesburg, South Africa","Globally, the poor are consistently at greater risk of suffering from depression and anxiety. Yet in resource-poor countries, mental health remains a neglected topic. This interdisciplinary study explored the potential for a poverty alleviation programme to contribute to breaking the vicious cycle between poverty and common mental disorders (CMD). Quantitatively, beneficiaries of a cash-transfer programme were found to have a lower risk of CMD. Qualitative interviews indicated that Child Support Grants acted as a psychological safety net, but that negative stereotypes of grant recipients could detract from the positive mental health outcomes of the grants. It was concluded that poverty alleviation programmes such as cash transfers could have both positive and negative impacts on mental health. In order to achieve mental health benefits for programme beneficiaries, aspects of programme design and implementation that promote mental health should be enhanced and aspects detrimental to mental health modified.

"Food Quality, Calories and Household Income","We investigate the relationship between calories, food quality and household per capita expenditure using regression and semiparametric methods on a sample of poor households from rural Mexico, where Programa de Apoyo Alimentario (PAL), a targeted nutritional programme, is operating. The semiparametric method yields an estimate of the elasticity between calories and expenditure of 0.39 below the median and 0.28 above. The corresponding estimates of the elasticity of the calorie price are 0.48 below the median and 0.45 above. We also examine the extent to which the expenditure elasticity of the calorie price is explained by substitution between and within major food groups. We find that there is a very high incidence of substitution within cereals (especially for poor households) and that between group substitution explains at most 59% of the income elasticity for food quality. These estimates suggest that the potential of a cash transfer programme to have a positive impact on the food diversity and the nutritional status of households is quite limited."," Skoufias, EmmanuelWorld BankU College LondonINSP, CuernavacaINSP, CuernavacaEmmanuelEmmanuel SkoufiasSkoufiasSkoufias, Emmanuel , Di Maro, VincenzoVincenzoVincenzo Di MaroDi MaroDi Maro, Vincenzo , Gonzalez-Cossio, TeresaTeresaTeresa Gonzalez-CossioGonzalez-CossioGonzalez-Cossio, Teresa , Ramirez, Sonia RodriguezSoniaSonia Rodriguez RamirezRamirezRodriguezRamirez, Sonia Rodriguez",http://search.proquest.com/docview/925701781?accountid=14496," Household Saving, Personal Finance (D14) , Taxation and Subsidies: Externalities, Redistributive Effects, Environmental Taxes and Subsidies (H23) , Health Production (I12) , Microeconomic Analyses of Economic Development (O12) , Economic Development: Urban, Rural, Regional, and Transportation Analysis, Housing, Infrastructure (O18) , Urban, Rural, Regional, Real Estate, and Transportation Economics: Regional Migration, Regional Labor Markets, Population, Neighborhood Characteristics (R23) , Mexico , Latin America and the Caribbean , Rural",EconLit,2011
Must conditional cash transfer programs be conditioned to be effective? The impact of conditioning transfers on school enrollment in Mexico,"A growing body of evidence suggests that conditional cash transfer (CCT) programs can have strong, positive effects on a range of welfare indicators for poor households in developing countries. However, there is little evidence about how important each component of these programs is towards achieving these outcomes. This paper tests the importance of conditionality on one specific outcome related to human capital formation, school enrollment, using data collected during the evaluation of Mexico's PROGRESA program. We exploit the fact that some beneficiaries who received transfers did not receive the forms needed to monitor the attendance of their children at school. We use a variety of techniques, including nearest neighbor matching and household fixed effects regressions, to show that the absence of these forms reduced the likelihood that children attended school with this effect most pronounced when children are transitioning to lower secondary school. We provide substantial evidence that these findings are not driven by unobservable characteristics of households or localities.

Cash or condition? Evidence from a cash transfer experiment,"This article assesses the role of conditionality in cash transfer programs using a unique experiment targeted at adolescent girls in Malawi. The program featured two distinct interventions: unconditional transfers (UCT arm) and transfers conditional on school attendance (CCT arm). Although there was a modest decline in the dropout rate in the UCT arm in comparison with the control group, it was only 43% as large as the impact in the CCT arm at the end of the two-year program. The CCT arm also outperformed the UCT arm in tests of English reading comprehension. However, teenage pregnancy and marriage rates were substantially lower in the UCT than the CCT arm, entirely due to the impact of UCTs on these outcomes among girls who dropped out of school.

Impact of Cash Transfer Programmes on School Attendance and Child Poverty: An Ex Ante Simulation for Sri Lanka,"For countries assessing whether to implement a cash transfer programme, an ex-ante evaluation is vital to assess its potential impacts. This study simulates the impact of alternative cash transfer programmes on school attendance and poverty among Sri Lankan children. We find that cash transfer programmes targeting poor children would be the most cost-effective way to reduce child poverty and encourage school attendance. If means-testing is not feasible, then programmes targeting the children in households with at least three school-age children would provide a suitable second-best solution.

The history and impact of social security in South Africa: experiences and lessons,"This paper examines the history and impact of the rapidly expanding social protection system in South Africa. We document the dominance of cash transfer-based assistance programmes compared to social insurance. There is a clear racial pattern of social protection coverage, with Africans benefitting largely from social assistance and whites being disproportionately covered by social insurance. We also find that the expanded social assistance has a substantial impact on poverty and nutrition, with little evidence of adverse labour market effects. The programme appears to be affordable and, in the South African context, administratively feasible.

Beyond the social protection paradigm: social policy in Africa's development,"The experience of sub-Saharan Africa with social development in the period between 1981 and 2005 has been grim, indeed. Over the period, policy focus has turned from a wider vision of social policy to narrow social protection concerns. This is what we refer to as the social protection paradigm (SPP). We offer an assessment of the paradigm. In its place, we offer an alternative vision encapsulated in the idea of transformative social policy, stressing the multiple roles of social policy and its wider vision of society. Social policy, in the context of meeting Africa's development challenges, must embrace these multiple roles, framed by the norms of equality and social solidarity.

Fertility impact of high-coverage public pensions in sub-Saharan Africa,"The potential link between child-related cash transfers and increased fertility is often raised as an issue of concern in debates as to their use. Old age pensions are a form of cash transfer where theory would suggest the opposite impact, namely, pensions equalling decreasing fertility. A handful of sub-Saharan African countries have introduced non-contributory social pensions that cover the great majority of the older population. This makes these countries a distinctive group in relation to the rest of the region, where public old age security arrangements, if they exist at all, are largely confined to the formal sector. This article attempts to trace the impact these high-coverage pension schemes may have had on fertility. The findings suggest there has been such an impact, to the extent of 0.5 to 1.5 fewer children per woman, depending on model specification. However, data limitations and methodological concerns require that the results be interpreted cautiously.

Mind the Gap--German Motherhood Risks in Figures and Game Theory Issues,"After childbirth, while parents are delighted at public cash transfers like the German 'Elterngeld' (parental leave benefit), the decline in mothers' earnings capacity is an awkward issue that tends to hover in the background. This paper aims firstly to make a contribution to quantifying West German mothers' foregone gross earnings that stem from intermittent labor market participation, due to the birth of their first child. Secondly, it discusses behavioral outcomes of the resulting implicit child costs in a dynamic bargaining model of household decisions. The regression results of a Mincer-type wage equation, with German Socio-Economic Panel Data (West) for the period 1984-2005 and correcting for sample selection (two-step Heckman), indicate considerable wage penalties due to birth-related employment withdrawal. On the closure of the fecund window, mothers suffer gross hourly wage cuts of up to 25%, compared to their equally educated, non-stop full-time employed counterparts, and the total of annualized losses amounts to as much as 201,000 Euros. Although foregone earnings do not matter as much in stable partnerships, they turn out to be a veritable asymmetric specialization risk that can prevent women from having children, if divorce seems sufficiently probable."," Boll, ChristinaHWWI, HamburgChristinaChristina BollBollBoll, Christina",http://search.proquest.com/docview/919221764?accountid=14496," Household Production and Intrahousehold Allocation (D13) , Welfare, Well-Being, and Poverty: Government Programs, Provision and Effects of Welfare Programs (I38) , Economics of Gender, Non-labor Discrimination (J16) , Time Allocation and Labor Supply (J22) , Wage Level and Structure, Wage Differentials (J31) , Germany , Europe , Earnings , Hourly Wages , Households , Motherhood , Mothers , Parental Leave , Participation , Transfers , Wage , Women",EconLit,2011
Evaluating the Impact of Conditional Cash Transfer Programs on Fertility: The Case of the Red De Proteccion Social in Nicaragua,"Evaluating the impact of poverty-reduction programs on fertility is complicated given that changes in incentives to have children take time to be incorporated into decision making and evaluation periods are usually quite brief. We explore the use of birth spacing as a short-run indicator of the impact of poverty-reduction programs on fertility. The data come from a Nicaraguan conditional cash transfer program that offers incentives for poor households to invest in children's health, nutrition, and education. We estimate a stratified Cox proportional hazard model and find that the program decreased the hazard of a birth, indicating an increase in birth spacing."," Todd, Jessica EEconomic Research Service, USDAAmerican UHebrew U JerusalemJessicaJessica E ToddToddETodd, Jessica E , Winters, PaulPaulPaul WintersWintersWinters, Paul , Stecklov, GuyGuyGuy StecklovStecklovStecklov, Guy",http://search.proquest.com/docview/925702614?accountid=14496," Taxation and Subsidies: Externalities, Redistributive Effects, Environmental Taxes and Subsidies (H23) , Welfare, Well-Being, and Poverty: Government Programs, Provision and Effects of Welfare Programs (I38) , Fertility, Family Planning, Child Care, Children, Youth (J13) , Microeconomic Analyses of Economic Development (O12) , Economic Development: Human Resources, Human Development, Income Distribution, Migration (O15) , Nicaragua , Latin America and the Caribbean , Birth , Children , Education , Fertility , Health , Nutrition , Poor , Poverty , Transfers",EconLit,2011
The Federalism of Oil and Environmental Policy in Italy,"The paper focuses on the allocation of the rent from oil among levels of government and residents in Italy. While Italy is not particularly rich of natural resources, the production of hydrocarbons is not marginal and there are prospects for expansion of the production. A share of the rent appropriated by the public sector is assigned to Regions and Municipalities. Residents of the producing areas receive additional benefits from the producing companies and from the cash transfers from the central government. However, their perception of these benefits is lessened by the delayed implementation of the projects funded by the rent. This creates conflicts between the desire of the central government to expand the domestic production of oil, the concerns of environmental groups and the need of subnational governments to give adequate consideration to the environmental concerns of their citizens. Consistency between the assignment of the rent, on the one hand, and the management of environmental policy, on the other to the different levels of government becomes crucial to solve potential conflicts between governments and to ensure protection of the environment."," Brosio, GiorgioSIEP and U TurinENEL ItalgasGiorgioGiorgio BrosioBrosioBrosio, Giorgio , Vannini, AldoAldoAldo VanniniVanniniVannini, Aldo",http://search.proquest.com/docview/1030493471?accountid=14496," Taxation and Subsidies: Externalities, Redistributive Effects, Environmental Taxes and Subsidies (H23) , Intergovernmental Relations, Federalism, Secession (H77) , Energy: Demand and Supply, Prices (Q41) , Energy: Government Policy (Q48) , Environmental Economics: Government Policy (Q58) , Regional Economic Activity: Growth, Development, Environmental Issues, and Changes (R11) , Italy , Europe , Environment , Federalism , Municipalities , Natural Resource , Oil",EconLit,2011
Social Protection Policy for Poverty Reduction in Colombia: Conceptual Challenges,"Ten years after the ""war against poverty,"" the persistence of poverty and vulnerability in the face of financial and environmental crises, as well as the growing inequality of income and resource access, represent the challenges inherited from the 2000-2010 decade in terms of social protection. These challenges are even more significant when one considers that the concept of 'social risk management,' around which the model of social protection on a global scale was articulated over the past decade, was initiated alongside the promise of transforming risk into a socio-political issue, or, in other words, a topic of planning, prevention, and management and no longer a factor related to uncertainty characteristic of an uncertain and interconnected world. The continuing social effects of similar crises at the end of the 1990s represent a call to reexamine the risk management focus of social protection. This article discusses the legacy of Holzmann and Jorgensen's seminal paper from 1999 on 'social risk management' in the face of newer ideas on social protection emphasizing the centrality of assets and rights. It presents three conceptual challenges: considering how to transform the structure and causes of poverty and exclusion; the failure of conditional cash transfer approaches to sustainably reduce poverty; and the lack of a national policy to guarantee families secure and protected lives. The paper necessarily addresses the concepts of capabilities and of extending the freedom related to ""freedom for"" (achieve freedom/be free). It also explores the need to develop the concept of ""freedom from"" (critical events) that implies a deepening of insecurity.

The history and impact of social security in South Africa: experiences and lessons,"// ABSTRACT IN ENGLISH: This paper examines the history and impact of the rapidly expanding social protection system in South Africa. We document the dominance of cash transfer-based assistance programmes compared to social insurance. There is a clear racial pattern of social protection coverage, with Africans benefitting largely from social assistance and whites being disproportionately covered by social insurance. We also find that the expanded social assistance has a substantial impact on poverty and nutrition, with little evidence of adverse labour market effects. The programme appears to be affordable and, in the South African context, administratively feasible. We discuss potential economic and political incentive problems with the co-existence of social assistance and social insurance and, finally, the implications for the design of social protection programmes in other sub-Saharan African countries. // ABSTRACT IN FRENCH: Cette r_daction _tudie l'histoire et l'impact du systme de protection sociale qui est en expansion rapide en Afrique du Sud.

Vulnerability and risk management: the importance of financial inclusion for beneficiaries of conditional transfers in Colombia,"// ABSTRACT IN ENGLISH: This paper studies effects of savings, credit and insurance on the vulnerability of households to idiosyncratic income shocks. This approach is made through matching methods using data from around 650 households that have been beneficiaries of the Colombian conditional cash-transfer programme Familias en Accin.

Investing Cash Transfers to Raise Long-Term Living Standards,"Using data from a randomized experiment, we find that poor rural Mexican households invested part of their cash transfers from the Oportunidades program in productive assets, increasing agricultural income by almost 10 percent after 18 months of benefits. We estimate that for each peso transferred, households consume 74 cents and invest the rest, permanently increasing long-term consumption by about 1.6 cents. Results suggest that cash transfers can achieve long-term increases in consumption through investment in productive activities, thereby permitting beneficiary households to attain higher living standards that are sustained even after transitioning off the program."," Gertler, Paul JU CA, BerkeleyInter-American Bank, Washington, DCInstitute for Fiscal Studies, LondonPaulPaul J GertlerGertlerJGertler, Paul J , Martinez, Sebastian WSebastianSebastian W MartinezMartinezWMartinez, Sebastian W , Rubio-Codina, MartaMartaMarta Rubio-CodinaRubio-CodinaRubio-Codina, Marta",http://search.proquest.com/docview/913434646?accountid=14496," Household Saving, Personal Finance (D14) , Taxation and Subsidies: Externalities, Redistributive Effects, Environmental Taxes and Subsidies (H23) , Welfare, Well-Being, and Poverty: Government Programs, Provision and Effects of Welfare Programs (I38) , Microeconomic Analyses of Economic Development (O12) , Mexico , Latin America and the Caribbean , Transfers",EconLit,2012
Child Care Provision: Semiparametric Evidence from a Randomized Experiment in Mexico,"We estimate the impact of the Mexican conditional cash transfer program on the time mothers and older sisters spend taking care of children younger than 3. We exploit the random allocation of the program and heterogeneity in household composition for identification, and apply the methodology in Lewbel (2000). We find that mothers in treatment households substitute their first teenage daughter in the provision of child care. As a result, daughters devote more time to schooling and less time to taking care of their younger siblings. Overall, total household hours to child care increase.

World Development Report 2012: Gender Equality and Development- A Commentary,"That the World Bank has devoted its 2012 flagship publication to the topic of gender equality is a welcome opportunity for widening the intellectual space. However, it is also a missed opportunity. By failing to engage seriously with the gender biases of macroeconomic policy agendas that define contemporary globalization, and by reducing social policy to a narrow focus on conditional cash transfers, the report is unable to provide a credible and even-handed analysis of the challenges that confront gender equality in the 21st century and appropriate policy responses for creating more equal societies. This is the first time the World Bank has devoted its annual flagship publication to the topic of gender equality. Given the stature of the World Development Report and its influence on development debates, the 2012 edition is likely to attract the attention of numerous actors, both governmental and non-governmental. So what are we to make of the analysis and the messages that emerge from this report?

5 years in Juntos: new evidence on the program's short and long-term impacts,"This study presents results from a quantitative impact evaluation of the Conditional Cash Transfer (CCT) program, Juntos, in Peru. Using instrumental variable techniques, it estimates the overall impact of Juntos five years after its initial rollout and explores the differential impacts among beneficiaries according to the length of time they spent in the program. In so doing, the analysis explores whether it takes time for the program to make significant and sizable impacts; and whether some impacts change in magnitude the longer the beneficiaries spend in the program. The results seem to confirm both hypotheses: almost all indicators of interest are significantly higher among beneficiaries with longer treatment spells. However, in many cases these improvements are too small to be picked up in the analysis of overall effects, when beneficiaries are compared to non-beneficiaries. These findings suggest that while the program has a non negligible impact on welfare, there is room for improvement."," Perova, ElizavetaElizavetaElizaveta PerovaPerovaPerova, Elizaveta , Vakis, RenosRenosRenos VakisVakisVakis, Renos",http://search.proquest.com/docview/1625334927?accountid=14496," 11888 10472 , 3505 3502 7584 3977 5574 10472 5200 , 10319 4551 , 13521 , 11813 3483 , 5576 5574 10472 , 210 14 , 329 386 14",International Bibliography of the Social Sciences (IBSS),2012
The Last Shall be First: Political Dimensions of Conditional Cash Transfers in Brazil,"Early evidence suggests that Brazil's Bolsa Familia (Family Stipend) program, which currently benefits over 12 million poor families, has alleviated absolute poverty. Although hailed by many as an unqualified success, its political dimensions have been largely ignored or underplayed. These include, for example, the unashamed use of Bolsa Familia for electoral purposes, the spread of clientelism and patronage, and the growing dependence of Brazil's poor on income transfers rather than productive employment. Furthermore, there are indications that the popularity of Bolsa Familia is encouraging short-termism in social policy. Many Brazilian policy makers now seem to view the program as mainstream social policy rather than as a temporary measure-a perspective that could undermine longer-term investments in key areas such as health and basic education.

"Poverty, Gender and Social Protection: Child Support Grants in Soweto, South Africa","The reduction of poverty after the demise of apartheid is attributed largely to South Africa's expansive social protection program. A key driver of this growth has been the Child Support Grant established in 1998. Although the grant was not intended only for women caregivers of children, it is accessed mainly by women. This presents a rich opportunity to examine the gendered nature of poverty and to assess the contribution of the program to poverty reduction from a gender perspective.

Tackling Income Inequality: The Role of Taxes and Transfers,"Taxes and transfers reduce inequality in disposable income relative to market income. The effect varies, however, across OECD countries. The redistributive impact of taxes and transfers depends on the size, mix, and the progressivity of each component. Some countries with a relatively small tax and welfare system (e.g., Australia) achieve the same redistributive impact as countries characterised by much higher taxes and transfers (e.g., Germany) because they rely more on income taxes, which are more progressive than other taxes, and on means-tested cash transfers. This article provides an assessment of the redistributive effect of the main taxes and cash transfers, based on various OECD data sources, a set of policy indicators and a literature review. Using cluster analysis, it also identifies empirically four groups of countries with tax and transfer systems that share broadly similar features."," Joumard, IsabelleOECDOECDOECDIsabelleIsabelle JoumardJoumardJoumard, Isabelle , Pisu, MauroMauroMauro PisuPisuPisu, Mauro , Bloch, DebbieDebbieDebbie BlochBlochBloch, Debbie",http://search.proquest.com/docview/1347767769?accountid=14496," Personal Income, Wealth, and Their Distributions (D31) , Taxation and Subsidies: Externalities, Redistributive Effects, Environmental Taxes and Subsidies (H23) , Measurement and Analysis of Poverty (I32) , Welfare, Well-Being, and Poverty: Government Programs, Provision and Effects of Welfare Programs (I38) , OECD , Income , Inequality , Policy , Redistributive Effects , Tax , Taxes , Transfers , Welfare",EconLit,2012

Bottom-up Policy Diffusion: National Emulation of a Conditional Cash Transfer Program in Brazil,"Policy diffusion studies often invoke explanations that draw on the directional pressures for emulation, whether top-down, horizontal, or bottom-up. This article develops a theoretical framework that accounts for the multidirectional features of diffusion, including sub-national, cross-national, and international mechanisms, through the illustrative case of Brazil's federal adoption of Bolsa Escola (School Grant Program), a conditional cash transfer program that preceded the internationally acclaimed poverty alleviation program called Bolsa Familia (Family Grant Program). Using process tracing, I argue that bottom-up pressures, including professional norms and intergovernmental competition, were key for policy emulation. Cross-national competition had little effect on decision-making. Finally, top-down processes, including norms and financing, reinforced adoption decisions and ensured these programs would endure.

Conditional cash transfers in Latin America,"Today, conditional cash transfers (CCTs) constitute the new fashionable tool in poverty-reduction policy (as were micro-credits a few years back). The popularity of CCTs with scholars and international institutions rests for a great deal on the positive impacts that have been highlighted by many CCTs assessment reports. In recent years, under the influence of their positive image and innovative design features, CCTs have rapidly expanded all over the world. In this article, we will try to assess if this enthusiasm is justified by evaluating the impact of four different CCT programmes in Latin America. And, more particularly, assess whether they constitute a genuine long-term commitment towards a more universal provision of social assistance and public services in Latin America. //ABSTRACT IN FRENCH: Aujourdhui, les transferts mon_taires conditionnels (TMC) sont le nouvel outil  la mode dans les politiques de r_duction de la pauvret_.

Cash at Your Fingertips: Biometric Technology for Transfers in Developing Countries,"In recent years, interest has soared in the development potential of well-designed cash transfer programs. One particular application is the use of transfers by resource-rich countries (as recently initiated by Iran) to distribute rents across their populations. An emerging body of research suggests that the development impact of such programs tends to be positive and that, especially when received by poor individuals or households, they can unlock constraints on economic activities, allowing a further increase in income. This paper considers the use of biometric technology to underpin transfer programs and how new technology is opening up possibilities for effective transfer programs that, up to now, have only been a theoretical option in the institutional conditions that prevail in many developing countries. Once implemented, biometric identification systems can be used to support a wide range of other development initiatives including banking, voting, health care, and general identification systems. The paper reviews some of the programs using these technologies and how it is enabling poor countries to leapfrog rich ones in the area of identity, much as the cellphone revolution did in the area of communications.

Conditional Cash Transfers and HIV/AIDS Prevention: Unconditionally Promising,"Conditional cash transfers (CCTs) have recently received considerable attention as a potentially innovative and effective approach to the prevention of HIV/AIDS. We evaluate a conditional cash transfer program in rural Malawi which offered financial incentives to men and women to maintain their HIV status for approximately one year. The amounts of the reward ranged from zero to approximately 3-4 months wage. We find no effect of the offered incentives on HIV status or on reported sexual behavior. However, shortly after receiving the reward, men who received the cash transfer were 9 percentage points more likely and women were 6.7 percentage points less likely to engage in risky sex. Our analyses therefore question the ""unconditional effectiveness"" of CCT program for HIV prevention: CCT Programs that aim to motivate safe sexual behavior in Africa should take into account that money given in the present may have much stronger effects than rewards offered in the future, and any effect of these programs may be fairly sensitive to the specific design of the program, the local and/or cultural context, and the degree of agency an individual has with respect to sexual behaviors.

"How to deal with covert child labor and give children an effective education, in a poor developing country","Because credit and insurance markets are imperfect and intrafamily transfers and how children use their time outside school hours are private information, the second-best policy makes school enrollment compulsory, forces overt child labor below its efficient level (if positive), and uses a combination of need- and merit-based grants, financed by earmarked taxes, to relax credit constraints, redistribute, and insure. Existing conditional cash transfer schemes can be made to approximate the second-best policy by incorporating these principles in some measure.

"Crises, Food Prices, and the Income Elasticity of Micronutrients: Estimates from Indonesia","The 2008 global food price crisis and more recent food price spikes have led to a greater focus on policies and programs to cushion the effects of such shocks on poverty and malnutrition. Analysis of the income elasticities of micronutrients and their changes during food price crises can shed light on the potential effectiveness of cash transfer and nutrition supplement programs. This article examines these issues using data from two cross-sectional household surveys in Indonesia, taken before (1996) and soon after (1999) the 1997-98 economic crisis, which led to a sharp increase in food prices. First, using nonparametric and regression methods, the article examines how the income elasticity of calories from starchy staples as a share of total calories differs between the two survey rounds. Second, the article estimates income elasticities of important nutrients in Indonesia. The analysis finds that, although summary measures such as the income elasticity of the starchy staple ratio might not change during crises, this stability masks important differences across individual nutrients. In particular, income elasticities of some key micronutrients, such as iron, calcium, and vitamin B1, are significantly higher in a crisis year than in a normal year, yet the income elasticities of others--such as vitamin C--remain close to zero. These results suggest that cash transfer programs might be even more effective during crises to ensure the consumption of essential micronutrients. But to ensure that all key micronutrients are consumed, nutrition supplement programs are also likely required."," Skoufias, EmmanuelWorld BankWorld Bank and Brown UWorld BankEmmanuelEmmanuel SkoufiasSkoufiasSkoufias, Emmanuel , Tiwari, SaileshSaileshSailesh TiwariTiwariTiwari, Sailesh , Zaman, HassanHassanHassan ZamanZamanZaman, Hassan",http://search.proquest.com/docview/1265883711?accountid=14496," Health Production (I12) , Health: Government Policy, Regulation, Public Health (I18) , Measurement and Analysis of Poverty (I32) , Welfare, Well-Being, and Poverty: Government Programs, Provision and Effects of Welfare Programs (I38) , Economic Development: Agriculture, Natural Resources, Energy, Environment, Other Primary Products (O13) , Economic Development: Human Resources, Human Development, Income Distribution, Migration (O15) , Agricultural Policy, Food Policy (Q18) , Indonesia , Asia , Food , Malnutrition , Nutrition , Poverty , Transfers",EconLit,2012
"'We are all poor here': economic difference, social divisiveness and targeting cash transfers in Sub-Saharan Africa","While the central thrust of Michael Lipton's work has been the crucial role of productivity gains in small farm agriculture for rural poverty reduction, in many sub-Saharan African countries this desirable outcome has stubbornly refused to materialise, and growing numbers of rural poor people are found persistently to fail to secure even minimal acceptable levels of food consumption. A social protection policy response is to target social cash transfers to the chronic extreme poor. This article focuses on the level of cash transfers relative to income differences between households in the bottom half of the income distribution, and the social tensions that arise from beneficiary selection and exclusion. It is found that cash transfers to target groups such as 'the poorest 10 per cent' or the 'ultra-poor labour constrained' must be set low, even below the welfare levels they seek to achieve, if they are to avoid socially invidious reshuffling of the income distribution. The article identifies critical trade-offs between the cost and coverage of different types of social transfer, their social acceptability and their political traction, helping to explain the reluctance of governments to adopt scaled-up poverty-targeted transfers as the preferred form of social cash transfer to those most in need in their societies.

The politics of social rights: social protection and free health care in Nepal,"This article examines the first steps in developing broad-based social insurance in Nepal, focusing on social protection cash transfers and the provision of free essential health care. Policy changes have been skilfully promoted by politically influential individuals with a strong vision for the development of social policies while the circumstances of political 'transition' have created an opportunity for defining universal rights in the Constitution. A political consensus has developed in favour of these policies because of the electoral advantages that have accrued to their promoters. Implementation has been favoured by the administrative simplicity of the measures taken though a more stable political environment will be required for deeper institutional change.

The Political Implications of Cash Transfers in Sub-saharan Africa: Shaking up the social system,"Following success in Latin America, cash transfers are rapidly gaining currency as a principal tool for social protection in Africa. Pilot projects abound, but are often conceived and evaluated without much attention to the political and social implications of targeting, of payment systems, and of introducing cash into poor communities. These implications can be profound, and must be considered in designing cash transfer programmes. Using examples from Oxford Policy Management's evaluation and design work in Kenya, we discuss effects on the political and social fabric of in particular (1) targeting, (2) payments systems and (3) the overall process of cash transfers. First, who is targeted, how and who targets can radically alter local power relations, and this can have national consequences. Targeting divides communities into recipients and non-recipients, and this has consequences for social relations. Second, different payment systems create different requirements for civil registration, possibilities for fraud and opportunities for connectedness. These requirements and opportunities all have potential to change citizens' relationship with the State with far-reaching political implications. Finally, because of these effects, implementing a system of cash transfers (even a pilot project) is not an apolitical policy intervention and in fact will influence quite profoundly relationships between individuals within households, within communities and within the broader polity. This has an effect on the development direction of the country in question. We ask whether this should be the donors' role, and suggest greater engagement with national and local political actors in planning, designing and implementing cash transfer programmes.

"Unemployment, intervention and capabilities. A comparative study of Germany and Spain","ABSTRACT IN ENGLISH: Over the past 20 years, the social protection measures devoted to unemployed people in Europe have become more diverse. In an attempt to complement or curb cash transfers, many countries have put measures, services in kind and activation policies at the centre of social protection against unemployment. This article compares two countries with different policies: Spain, which still has very 'traditional' unemployment support with little emphasis on activation, and Germany, where there has in recent years been rapid change towards activation measures. The article evaluates these policies and their consequences on the unemployed by means of the capability model, investigating comparatively the effects of institutional intervention on the real set of options available to the unemployed in finding a decent job or pursuing training or other activities. The authors argue that cash transfers can increase capabilities 'by default', whereas more intervention-oriented public employment services need to give unemployed workers an active part in 'tailoring' supports to their needs. ABSTRACT IN FRENCH: En Europe, au cours de ces 20 dernires ann_es, les mesures de protection sociale destin_es aux chmeurs ont connu une diversification croissante. Pour tenter de compl_ter ou de r_duire les transferts d'argent, de nombreux pays ont plac_ des mesures, des services en nature et des politiques d'activation au coeur de la protection sociale contre le chmage. Cet article compare deux pays menant des politiques diff_rentes: l'Espagne, qui connat toujours un soutien trs  traditionnel  en faveur des chmeurs et met peu l'accent sur l'activation, et l'Allemagne, qui a connu ces dernires ann_es un changement rapide en faveur des mesures d'activation. L'article _value ces politiques et leurs cons_quences sur les chmeurs au moyen du modle des capacit_s, en _tudiant dans une perspective comparative les effets de l'intervention institutionnelle sur l'_ventail des options r_ellement disponibles aux chmeurs pour trouver un emploi d_cent, pour suivre une formation ou pour mener d'autres activit_s. Les auteurs indiquent que les transferts d'argent peuvent accrotre les capacit_s  par d_faut  alors que les services publics de l'emploi davantage ax_s sur l'orientation doivent donner aux travailleurs sans emploi un rle actif pour que les soutiens apport_s soient davantage  taill_s sur mesure , en fonction de leurs besoins. ABSTRACT IN GERMAN: In den vergangenen zwanzig Jahren haben sich die sozialen Sicherungen fr Arbeitslose in Europa ausdifferenziert. Um Geldleistungen zu erg_nzen oder zu beschneiden, haben viele Staaten Dienstleistungen und Aktivierungsmanahmen in den Mittelpunkt der sozialen Sicherung bei Arbeitslosigkeit gestellt. Dieser Artikel vergleicht zwei L_nder, deren politische Strategien sich unterscheiden: Spanien erbringt vor allem ""traditionelle"" Lohnersatzleistungen und verfolgt kaum aktivierende Ans_tze, wogegen Deutschland in den letzten Jahren rasch auf einen Aktivierungskurs einschwenkte. Dieser Artikel nutzt das Modell der Verwirklichungschancen (""capabilities""), um diese politischen Strategien und ihre Wirkungen fr die Arbeitslosen zu evaluieren. Er untersucht vergleichend, wie die institutionellen Interventionen sich auf die Bndel wirklicher Optionen auswirken, ber die Arbeitslose verfgen, um eine angemessene Stelle zu finden, sich beruflich weiterzubilden oder anderen Aktivit_ten nachzugehen. Der Autorin und den Autoren zufolge k_nnen Lohnersatzleistungen als ""hilfsweise"" chancenfreundlich gelten. Eine st_rker auf Intervention orientierte Arbeitsverwaltung msste jedoch Arbeitsuchende aktiver daran beteiligen, Untersttzungsleistungen ""passgenau"" an ihren Bedarfen auszurichten.

Social protection and children in developing countries,"Children are one of the most vulnerable groups in almost any population because of their physical and emotional dependence on adults and social status. Their vulnerability is greater in developing countries because of the higher incidence of poverty and fewer social protection mechanisms in place compared to industrialized countries. In most developing countries, children are not the explicit recipients of the unprecedented growth in social protection efforts but do benefit from its expansion. This paper looks at how social protection is evolving in developing countries and how it relates to the vulnerabilities of children. It goes on to present the different conceptual models for protection and how they have changed and been influenced by the changing definition of poverty and the growth in transnational knowledge and policymaking. The paper then considers cash transfer programs that have been introduced and their effects on child well being. It ends with a discussion of the need to focus on system-wide social protection strategies to address children's vulnerabilities and future directions needed.

The fiscal cost of child grants in the context of high adult mortality in South Africa: a simulation to 2015,"This paper investigates the expected costs of cash transfers to children in South Africa up to 2015. The child population is not expected to grow between 2008 and 2015 and thus the fiscal cost of the Child Support Grant is expected to stabilise in the near future. The other major child grant, the Foster Care Grant, is far less predictable - while it is not intended to be an orphan grant, three quarters of its beneficiaries are orphans. Because of the HIV/AIDS pandemic, the number of dual orphans is expected to double between 2008 and 2015, reaching 1.3 million, and the overall number of orphans (maternal, paternal and dual) to reach 4.8 million by 2015. If the Foster Care Grant were to become a de facto orphan grant, its costs would escalate rapidly. The paper does not argue in favour of an orphan grant, but rather for greater effort in ensuring that the Child Support Grant reaches the neediest children, especially maternal orphans.

Food and cash transfers: evidence from Colombia,"We study food Engel curves amongst the poor population targeted by a conditional cash transfer programme in Colombia. After controlling for the endogeneity of total consumption and for the price variability across villages, our estimates imply that an increase in consumption by 10% would lead to a decrease of 1% in the share of food. However, quasi-experimental estimates of the impact of the programme show that the share of food increases. This result is not inconsistent with the hypothesis that the programme could increase the bargaining power of women, inducing a more than proportional increase in food consumption.

"The Impact of the Bolsa Escola/Familia Conditional Cash Transfer Program on Enrollment, Dropout Rates and Grade Promotion in Brazil","We examine the impact of Brazil's Bolsa Escola/Familia program on Brazilian children's education outcomes. Bolsa provides cash payments to poor households if their children (ages 6 to 15) are enrolled in school. Using school census data to compare changes in enrollment, dropping out and grade promotion across schools that adopted Bolsa at different times, we estimate that the program has: increased enrollment by about 5.5% (6.5%) in grades 1-4 (grades 5-8); lowered dropout rates by 0.5 (0.4) percentage points in grades 1-4 (grades 5-8); and raised grade promotion rates by 0.9 (0.3) percentage points in grades 1-4 (grades 5-8). About one third of Brazil's children participate in Bolsa, so assuming no spillover effects onto non-participants implies that Bolsa's impacts are three times higher than these estimates. However, simple calculations using enrollment impacts suggest that Bolsa's benefits in terms of increased wages may not exceed its costs."," Glewwe, PaulU MNU Sao PauloPaulPaul GlewweGlewweGlewwe, Paul , Kassouf, Ana LuciaAnaAna Lucia KassoufKassoufLuciaKassouf, Ana Lucia",http://search.proquest.com/docview/919223305?accountid=14496," Taxation and Subsidies: Externalities, Redistributive Effects, Environmental Taxes and Subsidies (H23) , Analysis of Education (I21) , Education and Inequality (I24) , Fertility, Family Planning, Child Care, Children, Youth (J13) , Economic Development: Human Resources, Human Development, Income Distribution, Migration (O15) , Brazil , Latin America and the Caribbean , Children , Education , Poor , Wage",EconLit,2012

Do Cash Transfers Crowd Out Community Investment in Public Goods? Lessons from a Field Experiment on Health Education,"This article discusses voluntary contributions to health education in Peru, using a new experimental setup to identify voluntary contributions to local public goods. The experiment enables individuals to contribute to a health education meeting facilitated by an NGO, which they know will only be organized if the cumulative investment level exceeds a certain threshold value. In contrast to expectations of aid distributors, individuals contributed a substantial amount of money, despite the supposed long-term nature of the benefits. The result suggests that donor paternalism, undermining the agency of beneficiaries to exercise control over funds, is not always necessary to guarantee investment in local public goods. We explore multiple interpretations, suggesting that ""unaccounted for"" short-term benefits from participation as well as liquidity and paternalistic altruism add to explaining the relatively high investment. More in general, the article shows the potential for using experimental research methods in the area of nonprofit management.

Examining the reliability of self-reported data on school participation,"Many studies evaluate the impacts of Conditional Cash Transfer (CCT) programs on schooling using self-reports on enrollment and attendance even though there are reasons to doubt the reliability of these data. In this paper, we examine the extent to which school-age girls overstate their school participation. Using administrative data from a cash transfer experiment in Malawi and school attendance ledgers collected as part of the impact evaluation, we find that while all study participants overstate their enrollment and attendance rates, the extent to which this happens is significantly higher in the control group than the CCT arm. This finding implies that exclusive reliance on self-reported school participation data can lead to a serious underestimation of actual program impacts. We recommend that self-reports be supplemented using alternative sources of data on school participation that are appropriate to the experiment at hand - even if such efforts are likely to increase evaluation costs.

Self-Control and Provision of Education Subsidies,"This paper provides a simple yet unified framework that not only provides a rationale for a government's education subsidies but also allows us to examine what kinds of subsidies would be the least costly. The paper builds a model based on hyperbolic discounting utilities in which a government's intervention in education is justified to ease individual's self-control problem leading to the underinvestment in education; it shows that when the degree of self-control problem is high (low), conditional cash transfer is more (less) cost-effective than price subsidies. Those model predictions are consistent with the empirical patterns observed in education subsidies around the world."," Lee, SoohyungU MDSoohyungSoohyung LeeLeeLee, Soohyung",http://search.proquest.com/docview/1777458105?accountid=14496," Intertemporal Household Choice, Life Cycle Models and Saving (D91) , National Government Expenditures and Education (H52) , State and Local Government: Health, Education, Welfare, Public Pensions (H75) , Educational Finance, Financial Aid (I22) , Education: Government Policy (I28) , Economic Development: Human Resources, Human Development, Income Distribution, Migration (O15) , Selected Countries , Discounting , Education , Subsidies",EconLit,2012
Gender bias in intrahousehold allocation: evidence from an unintentional experiment,"We use data from a Brazilian social program to investigate the existence of gender bias in intrahousehold allocations of resources. The program makes cash transfers to mothers and pregnant women in poor households. Bureaucratic mistakes, beyond the control of the applicants, have inadvertently excluded many households that had applied and were accepted to the program. This unintentional natural experiment is used to identify the impact of an exogenous variation in female nonlabor income over household consumption. We find that program participation led to an increase in food expenditure, but this effect is not due to women being the benefit recipients.

Distributive Politics and Conditional Cash Transfers: The Case of Brazil's Bolsa Familia,"Brazilian politicians have long relied on pork and clientelism to win political support, and recent literature suggests that little has changed. However, researchers have yet to systematically investigate whether political criteria influence the distribution of funds through Bolsa Familia. This is especially surprising given the program's prominence in the international community. In this paper, I examine whether political criteria explain the federal government's distribution of Bolsa Familia. I find little evidence that political criteria explain the difference between the number of poor families that live in a municipality and the number of families that receive support. I conclude by discussing the broader significance of this large, programmatic policy to Brazil's political development.

Prospects and Challenges for the Basic Income Proposal in Latin America,"Basic Income (BI) aims to guarantee a universal and unconditional income to everyone. However, Latin America has income programmes for economically dependent people. These trends pose specific questions for the BI debate: can a universal and unconditional policy be reached starting from a conditional targeted policy? How would those conditionalities be considered in order to improve human capital? I discuss the Latin American road to BI and look at the Brazilian Bolsa Familia and the Asignacion Universal por Hijo (recently approved in Argentina) programmes. Both schemes are chosen because they share common characteristics of Conditional Cash Transfer programmes. Furthermore, they are among the few in the region considered part of the BI debate: in the case of Brazil, as part of the Lei de Renda Basica de Cidadania, and in the case of Argentina, as a response to the bill proposals presented at the National Congress.

Child protection: a role for conditional cash transfer programmes?,"Drawing on empirical data from a community-based study with children and adults in rural Peru, the paper analyses the everyday experiences of a conditional cash transfer programme, called ' Juntos '. The findings show that social protection programmes like Juntos address certain child vulnerabilities by making eligibility for their cash transfers conditional on behaviour-related to child protection-related such as health check-ups and school attendance. However, there are other aspects of children's well-being that are not being considered, such as experiences of violence and exclusion. This paper discusses both opportunities and challenges for cash transfer programmes to play a greater role in child protection.

Young Malawi Women Who Get Payments for Schooling Are Less Likely to Get HIV,"In a cluster randomized trial that assessed a cash transfer program in Malawi, young women who received monthly payments were less likely than others to become infected with HIV or herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2)-but only if they had been attending school at the start of the trial. Among young women who had been enrolled in school at baseline, the prevalence of HIV at the 18-month follow-up was lower among those receiving payments than among those in an unpaid control group (1.2% vs. 3.0%); findings were similar for infection with HSV-2 (0.7% vs. 3.0%). However, among participants who had dropped out of school by baseline, the intervention and control groups had similar levels of HIV (8-10%) and HSV-2 (8% each) at follow-up.

"The schooling decision: family preferences, intergenerational conflict, and moral hazard in the Brazilian Favelas","This paper experimentally analyzes the schooling decisions of poor households in urban Brazil. We elicit parents' choices between monthly government transfers conditional on their adolescent child attending school and guaranteed, unconditional transfers of varying sizes. In the baseline treatment, an overwhelming majority of parents prefer conditional transfers to larger unconditional transfers. However, few parents prefer conditional payments if they are offered text message notifications whenever their child misses school. These findings suggest important intergenerational conflicts in these schooling decisions, a lack of parental control and observability of school attendance, and an additional rationale for conditional cash transfer programs--the monitoring they provide.

Household Economy and Livelihoods among Iraqi Refugees in Syria,"According to current estimates, Syria hosts the largest number of Iraqi refugees in the region. This study aimed to provide information on the household economy and livelihoods among Iraqi refugees residing in urban areas of Syria. A nationally representative 80 * 10 cluster survey of Iraqi refugee households (total n = 800) was conducted in March 2009. Overall, 69 per cent of households reported having financial difficulties; 14 per cent fell below the poverty line of US$1/person/day and 41 per cent were living on less than US$2/person/day. High levels of dependency on remittances, pensions, and UN support were observed. Nearly 40 per cent of households reported an employed member, of whom 58 per cent reported workplace difficulties. Uncertain legal status and inability to work in the formal sector are principal concerns among the Iraqi population in Syria. Humanitarian assistance planners should consider livelihoods and cash transfer programmes that promote income generation and reduce dependency on savings and other outside sources.

Improving access to maternity services: an overview of cash transfer and voucher schemes in South Asia,"In Nepal, India, Bangladesh and Pakistan, policy focused on improving access to maternity services has led to measures to reduce cost barriers impeding women's access to care. Specifically, these include cash transfer or voucher schemes designed to stimulate demand for services, including antenatal, delivery and post-partum care. In spite of their popularity, however, little is known about the impact or effectiveness of these schemes. This paper provides an overview of five major interventions: the Aama (Mothers') Programme (cash transfer element) in Nepal; the Janani Suraksha Yojana (Safe Motherhood Scheme) in India; the Chiranjeevi Yojana (Scheme for Long Life) in India; the Maternal Health Voucher Scheme in Bangladesh and the Sehat (Health) Voucher Scheme in Pakistan. It reviews the aims, rationale, implementation challenges, known outcomes, potential and limitations of each scheme based on current available data. Increased use of maternal health services has been reported since the schemes began, though evidence of improvements in maternal health outcomes has not been established due to a lack of controlled studies. Areas for improvement in these schemes, identified in this review, include the need for more efficient operational management, clear guidelines, financial transparency, plans for sustainability, evidence of equity and, above all, proven impact on quality of care and maternal mortality and morbidity.

"TRENDS IN AMERICAN LIVING STANDARDS AND INEQUALITY, 1959-2007","We analyze the trends from 1959 to 2007 using an expanded measure of income called the Levy Institute Measure of Economic Well-Being (LIMEW). LIMEW is different in scope from the official U.S. Census Bureau measure of gross money income (MI) in that our measure includes non-cash transfers, public consumption, imputed income from wealth, and household production and nets out personal taxes. While the annual growth rates of median LIMEW and MI are very close over the whole period (0.67 and 0.63 percent), median LIMEW grew much faster than median MI after 1982 and much slower before. The Gini coefficient of MI is uniformly higher than that of LIMEW but both show about the same change from 1959 to 2007. Decomposition analysis shows that changes in inequality are driven to a large extent by non-home wealth in LIMEW and earnings in MI. While the racial gap in MI declined somewhat over the 1990s and 2000s, the racial gap in LIMEW actually widened a bit. Over the same years, while there was little change in the gap in MI between the elderly and non-elderly, the LIMEW of the elderly actually overtook that of the non-elderly.

Income transfer policies and the impacts on the immunization of children: the Bolsa Familia Program,This paper investigates the impact of the Bolsa Familia Program on the immunization of children from 0 to 6 years of age in Brazil and its regions. The Bolsa Familia program is a conditional cash transfer program. One of its conditionalities is the compliance of children with the immunization schedule ordered by the Ministry of Health. The evaluation was performed using the Propensity Score Matching technique. We used data from a survey conducted in 2005 evaluating the program -- Pesquisa de Avaliacao de Impacto do Programa Bolsa Familia. The main findings suggest that the Bolsa Familia Program does not affect the immunization status of children.

Cash Transfers and Children's Education and Labour among Malawi's Poor,"This article examines the impact on children's education and labour of monthly cash grants targeted on ultra-poor households and designed to reduce poverty and enable families to invest in human development. It conducts a randomised community trial, with baseline and endline surveys of intervention and control households; verifies school enrolment; and completes key-informant interviews and focus-group discussions. Compared with non-beneficiaries, intervention children experienced a 5 percentage point difference in enrolment, higher educational expenditures, fewer absences, and a 10 percentage point decrease in labour outside the home. Qualitative data confirm the quantitative findings. Transfers to poor households had a positive impact.

Are conditional cash transfers effective in urban areas? Evidence from Mexico,"Conditional cash transfer (CCT) programs have spread worldwide as a new form of social assistance for the poor. Previous evaluations of CCT programs focus mainly on rural settings, and little is known about their effects in urban areas. This paper studies the short-term (1- and 2-year) effects of the Mexican Oportunidades CCT program on urban children/youth. The program provides financial incentives for children/youth to attend school and for family members to visit health clinics. To participate, families had to sign up for the program and be deemed eligible.

Cash transfers and citizenship: evidence from South Africa,"Theoretical research has assumed a role for cash transfers in forging a state-citizen contract, yet evidence is scarce regarding whether social protection promotes citizenship among claimants in practice. The article explores the implications of cash transfers for notions of citizenship in the narratives of transfer recipients in Johannesburg, South Africa. Cash transfers created a space for state-citizen exchange, helping topersonalise views of the state, and giving citizens grounds for holding the state accountable. However, boundaries between state and citizens' responsibilities were contested, suggesting that expectations of a contractual relationship with the state were weak. Cash transfers are an important but partial means of promoting citizenship. Reprinted by permission of Frank Cass & Co.

We develop a theoretical framework of the dynamics of the educational process including endogeneity and uncertainty of school performance. Using a randomized experiment implemented under Progresa, we identify the effect of the program on enrollment and performance in the first year of the program.

Welcome relief or indecent subsidy? The implications of wage top-up schemes,"A key policy response to the downward pressure on wages of the lowest-paid workers in the developed economies of the capitalist world has been the introduction of meanstested cash transfer schemes by which to top up low wages. Findings from a study of the experiences of the beneficiaries of a particular scheme (the United Kingdom's Working Tax Credit) suggest that, although schemes may serve to relieve the poverty of low-paid workers and their families, the extent to which they promote the accessibility of 'decent work' is ambiguous.

Conditional cash transfer to promote institutional deliveries in India: toward a sustainable ethical model to achieve MDG 5A,"The Millennium Development Goal (MDG) 5A states that the maternal mortality ratio has to be reduced to three-quarters between 1990 and 2015. The target for India is a maternal mortality ratio of 109/100,000 live births. The Janani Suraksha Yojna (JSY) (Maternal Protection Scheme) is a centrally sponsored conditional cash transfer scheme to promote institutional deliveries and thus ensure safe delivery and reduce maternal mortality. The JSY scheme and its various evaluations were reviewed. The Tannahill's ethical framework was applied to the JSY and analyzed. Evaluations have shown that the JSY has significantly increased institutional deliveries. The public health system is not fully geared up for delivering good quality maternal health services. Thus encouraging women to go to them violates the principle of doing good. There are several barriers for availing the scheme. Procuring the certificates to meet eligibility can be difficult. The women do not have power over the cash incentive. There are large inequities in access to the JSY scheme based on socioeconomic status, caste and education. The accountability mechanisms for the scheme are weak at the grassroots level. Without an overall improvement in health system and awareness among women, the JSY cannot be said to empower the women in a sustainable way. In order, that the increases in institutional deliveries due to JSY are more than just a Hawthorne effect, which is a change in behavior just due to the fact that the population is being closely observed and intervened, there is a need to bridge the ethical gaps in the program to make it an empowering, sustainable, accountable and just one."," Gopichandran, VijayaprasadSRM UniversityVijayaprasadVijayaprasad GopichandranGopichandranGopichandran, Vijayaprasad , Chetlapalli, Satish KumarSRM UniversitySatishSatish Kumar ChetlapalliChetlapalliKumarChetlapalli, Satish Kumar",http://search.proquest.com/docview/1240206905?accountid=14496," 8317 9184 , 8291 3409 6306 , 516 5775 13521 , 5778 4025 , 7879 4408 8282 8281 6085 , 7875 5775 13521 , 10449 5772 , 5783 5772 6489 , 175 387 30",International Bibliography of the Social Sciences (IBSS),2012
The Welfare Effects of Cash Transfers of Electrical Energy Subsidies on Iran Economy. (In Farsi. With English summary.),"Withdrawing energy subsidies has inevitably welfare effects on the Iranian economy. The estimation of this effect can help policy-makers and planners to make the right decisions. In this paper, welfare effects of cash transfer are calculated for electrical energy subsidies using a social accounting matrix and the computable general equilibrium model. In order to evaluate the welfare effect of this policy, GDP index has also been implemented. Three scenarios of prices, cash payment of subsidies and model simulation are considered in this regard. The research findings reveal that as a result of these policies, GDP will dramatically decrease and the economy will fall into a recession. If the cash payments are financed through the following three methods; a) surplus government revenues, b) sales tax on electricity commodity, c) income tax, combined with price increasing policy, will cause a deeper recession and a lower rate of GDP as a result. This trend has a negative and reverse relation with the amount of cash payment subsidies and electrical energy price. Also, the rate of change will heavily depend on the sort of financial resources for such subsidies, as with an increase in cash subsidies and electricity prices, the result would be decreased level of GDP over time."," Andargoly, Majid EslamiAbbaspour U TechnologyTarbiat Modares UTarbiat Modares UTarbiat Modares UMajidMajid Eslami AndargolyAndargolyEslamiAndargoly, Majid Eslami , Sadeghi, HosseinHosseinHossein SadeghiSadeghiSadeghi, Hossein , Ghanbari, AliAliAli GhanbariGhanbariGhanbari, Ali , Khabazan, Mohammad MohammadiMohammadMohammad Mohammadi KhabazanKhabazanMohammadiKhabazan, Mohammad Mohammadi",http://search.proquest.com/docview/1667945982?accountid=14496," Electric Utilities (L94) , Industry Studies: Utilities and Transportation: Government Policy (L98) , Economic Development: Agriculture, Natural Resources, Energy, Environment, Other Primary Products (O13) , Energy and the Macroeconomy (Q43) , Energy: Government Policy (Q48) , Iran , Asia , Electricity , Energy , GDP , Resources",EconLit,2012

Cash Transfers and Citizenship: Evidence from South Africa,"Theoretical research has assumed a role for cash transfers in forging a state-citizen contract, yet evidence is scarce regarding whether social protection promotes citizenship among claimants in practice. The article explores the implications of cash transfers for notions of citizenship in the narratives of transfer recipients in Johannesburg, South Africa. Cash transfers created a space for state-citizen exchange, helping to personalise views of the state, and giving citizens grounds for holding the state accountable. However, boundaries between state and citizens' responsibilities were contested, suggesting that expectations of a contractual relationship with the state were weak. Cash transfers are an important but partial means of promoting citizenship.

Financing the Elderly in Indonesia,"In developing countries, where the informal labor sector is large, the pay-as-you-go pension system is inapplicable. However, in order to maintain the distributional effect of a pension system, a kind of cash transfer for the elderly, taken from consumption taxes, is applicable. This notion of applying consumption taxes for older people's income is novel as it has never been applied anywhere, not even in Indonesia. This study analyzes how the capacity of consumption tax in Indonesian provinces is able to finance the economic lives of the elderly. The methodology and steps taken in this research are as follows: (a) Identifying consumption function for each province by using the life cycle-permanent income hypothesis (LCPIH) consumption function econometric model; (b) Predicting consumption function according to population trajectory for each province by using the Arima econometrics model; (c) Predicting the necessary amount to finance the elderly; and (d) Calculating the deficits (surplus) of the consumption tax under the older person financing. The findings are as follows. From the 30 provinces observed, four provinces show a low marginal tax rate (ranges lower than 2 per cent). While 13 provinces have a medium marginal tax rate (ranges from 2 to 4 per cent), the remaining 13 provinces show a high marginal tax rate (4 per cent and above). In addition, from the 30 provinces observed, 10 provinces show decreasing marginal tax indicators, three provinces show relatively constant marginal tax indicators, and the remaining 17 provinces show increasing marginal tax indicators. The conclusions are, first, that consumption taxes are applicable in Indonesia to finance the economic lives of the elderly; and second, that because not all Indonesian provinces are able to levy this type of tax without charging an overly high tax rate, some of the provinces that are not capable should seek assistance from the central government in terms of a block grant."," Widjaja, MuliadiU IndonesiaMuliadiMuliadi WidjajaWidjajaWidjaja, Muliadi",http://search.proquest.com/docview/1265881310?accountid=14496," Intertemporal Household Choice, Life Cycle Models and Saving (D91) , Informal Economy, Underground Economy (E26) , Social Security and Public Pensions (H55) , Economics of the Elderly, Economics of the Handicapped, Non-labor Market Discrimination (J14) , Nonwage Labor Costs and Benefits, Retirement Plans, Private Pensions (J32) , Economic Development: Human Resources, Human Development, Income Distribution, Migration (O15) , Indonesia , Asia , Developing Countries , Elderly , Life Cycle , Pay as You Go , Pension , Population",EconLit,2012
Local electoral incentives and decentralized program performance,"This paper analyzes how electoral incentives affected the performance of a major decentralized conditional cash transfer program intended on reducing school dropout rates among children of poor households in Brazil. We show that while this federal program successfully reduced school dropout by 8 percentage points, the program's impact was 36% larger in municipalities governed by mayors who faced reelection possibilities compared to those with lame-duck mayors. First-term mayors with good program performance were much more likely to be reelected. These mayors adopted program implementation practices that were not only more transparent but also associated with better program outcomes.
