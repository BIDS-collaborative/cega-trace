A public debate has ensued about the form that new or reformed cash transfers might take. While debating, we have introduced changes in our cash-transfer system, esp in the means-tested sector, without having explicitly chosen to take the direction which these changes imply. Thus, the changes that we have already adopted warrant serious re-examination. 2 of the issues in doubt are discussed. In some states we have already assured benefit levels in public assistance at or near the poverty line & have added an incentive scheme to this guarantee. We justify this policy by the faith that 'add-on' will lead to 'take-off.' This change in policy, however, is more likely to lead to the curious outcome that fam's are likely to be better off econ'ly when they are both at work & on welfare. To avoid this dilemma, we need a wagelevel policy which seeks to raise the wages in the marginal low-wage economy & to make it an alternative, rather than a supplement, to benefits. The impact which improvements in low wages could have on the rest of the economy is a critical issue, characterized more by passion than by understanding. We have been reluctant to debate a wage-level policy, & this remains the basic issue in the public review of cash transfers.

N. Ozawa ('Income Redistribution and Social Security,' Social Service Review, 1976, 50, June, 209-223) 'reorganized published data to show redistributive impacts of social security & public assistance on total income received by families of various income classes,' but was unable to disaggregate the groupings into demographic groups. S. Danziger was able to accomplish this disaggregation ('Income Redistribution and Social Security: Further Evidence,' Social Service Review, 1977, 51, Mar, 179-184). He also computed changes in mean income & Gini coefficients. Danziger's conceptual framework for calculating changes in mean income & Gini coefficients is discussed & research problems which derive from his observation on the increasing degree of inequality in income are explored. It is suggested that an estimate more precise than Danziger's 'of the net effect of social security can be otained by comparing the mean & the Gini coefficient of money income net of social security & public assistance, on one hand, & the mean & the Gini coefficient of money income net of public assistance, on the other.' Using this model it was found that the change in the mean income of all families due to social security benefits was 4.89% rather than Danziger's 4.83%. Methods used by Danziger to obtain the net effect of public assistance are consistent with the hierarchical order of income transfers. Further research is suggested in order to explore the effects of the changing tax structure on the distribution of income & to answer the questions of why the degree of income inequality has not been decreased despite growing expenditures for income-maintenance programs. In Author's Reply, S. Danziger (U of Wisconsin, Madison) describes his use of computer tapes from the Mar 1975 Current Population Survey in applying Ozawa's hierarchical odering to an analysis of 'the degree of poverty reduction attributable to three types of government cash transfers': social security, other government transfers, & public assistance. Findings agree with both researchers' previous results. Social security transfers are more redistributive than public assistance transfers, although social security is less target efficient than public assistance. 1 Table. G. Simpson."}]
